## Part 2

Saturday, August 1st, 2026, 2 PM.

The day before the typhoon passed through the Kanto region and today the blue sky spreading through it spread.

To Roppongi Hills Arena in Minato Ward, numerous media both domestic and oversea crowded, and now it was waiting for that time late.

A live stream went on the TV and the live stream went on the net has already started broadcasting at the press conference hall. An excited voice of a reporter or commentator overlaps the noise of the hall.

The remarks of the experts are largely negative tones.

_<<... .... So, no matter how close to the real thing it is, forever there is no real thing to be real. It is similar to medieval alchemy. Where you have cooked or baked iron or copper, you can not make gold absolutely!>>_

_<<But according to a pre-press release spread, they succeeded in reproducing the human brain structure itself ...>>_

_<<I say that it is impossible! Well, in our brain, there are ten billion brain cells. Do you think they can reproduce it on machine or computer program? Seriously?>>_

"Of course ...... Can’t watch this from home. Saying shit like that I thought."

Cursing, Klein loosening the tie sloppily and without hesitation having a gin tonic glass already at noon.

A coffee shop/cafe that hides between shops in the back streets of Okachimachi, Taito Ward, "Dicey Café" was filled with a number of people and had no room for a standing cone. Even if there are no ads or tags on the door, customers were still arriving.

Sinon, Leafa, Lisbet, Silica and Klein sit side by side at the counter in front of the shopkeeper Egil. The four tethered are also surrounded with former SAO players and ALO Lords Sakuya, Alisha, Eugene; Sleeping Nights Siune and Jun; Thinker, Yulier and Sasha.

Everyone was watching a large television set on the back wall with beer, cocktail and soft drinks in hand.

Lisbet returns sighing mixed words to Klein who still complains about their criticism.

"You can not help it. Actually I still find it hard to believe myself because they made artificial intelligence in that virtual world in the server."

The next Sinon also mumbles while touching the temple of the glasses.
