## Part 2

_He catches up._

Alice looking backwards on the saddle of the Amayuri shaved small lips.

The ominous black spots floating in the red sky are definitely larger than five minutes ago. Not the speed of the enemy increased, but the Amayuri and Takiguri are finally running out.

Naturally it is close to a miracle that she worked hard so far rather than to say - he kept flying without having to rest. From the central capital Centoria to the last mountain range, that is, a distance several times larger than the radius of the human world, we moved in a half day. Both heads are obviously continuing their marginal flight while intensely consuming our Life.

However, why do not those pursuers get exhausted as soon as?

It was confirmed by hyperopia with crystalloid, and seems to be on the back of a bizarre creature that is different from a dragon. I have never seen such creatures that only have to express as the wing 's raw disk, even in the human world as well as in the dark territory.

The archer, named Shinon, who came from the same "real world" as Kirito was saying. The pursuer is the dark territory emperor and the dark god Vector himself, his identity is a real world person in a position to hostile against Kirito and Shinon.

Emperor Vector once lost to the knight's sword of Bercouli - possibly the sacred treasure time sword release recollection technique. But with the new life he got down to this place again and chased Alice.

The anger that you can not forgive a bullshit "resuscitation" that ridicule the death of Bell Couri never vanishes.

But Alice found something to be done during a single flight.

If an enemy is said to be immortal in this world ——.

Before we kill it in real world.

For that reason, at any rate, we reach the "altar of the end".

Returning the line of sight to the front, it seems a little strange that cliffs of irreconcilable size climb up far beyond the red sky. It is a "wall of the end of the world" transmitted to Genesis myths. Unlike the mountain ranges of the human world that can be crossed over by the dragon, that cliff that surrounds the dark territory continues to infinite heights.

Before the cliff, nearly as high as Alice flies.

Only one small floating island is drifting.

It is impossible to guess what island that is shaped like a sharp cup at the bottom is floating in the empty space with any force.

As you close your eyes you can see some artificial structures in the center of the flat upper surface. It is probably the "altar of the end" that aims for. As the exit of the world, the entrance to Real World.

The remaining distance is cut off by 10 kiloliters, but unfortunately it will be slightly faster for Emperor Vector to catch up behind Alice than to arrive at the Alter.

Alice slowly breathed in and breathed.

Gently stroke the neck of love dragon with your right hand and order.

"Thank you for everything, Amayuri and Takiguri at the end so far, you should descend to the ground"

Two heads crowed with a weak voice, entered a spiral descent while lined up.

The underlying terrain has changed a bit ago into a cold dark gray desert. While drawing a long trajectory in the desert and continuing sand of the sea as if God got tired of the creation, the dragons landed halfway down.

Altering quickly jumped from the back of Amayuri that leaves the giant leaking voice from the back of the throat. Exploring the waist bag and taking out a small bottle of the remaining spirit remained.

Pour half of the blue liquid into the Amayuri's mouth that has become half open and pour the rest one drop into the mouth of the next brother dragon. Although it is a spirit made by an axiomatic church, it is totally insufficient to heal the enormous Life of the flying dragon, but still the power to take off once more should return.

Alice gently shriveled the under chin of the dragon's woolen hair with the left and right hands.

"Amayuri, Takiguri"

As soon as I called, tears floated in nature and both eyes. Continue it hard, keep on.

"Here is a farewell, the last command ... ... Fly to the human world, return to the dragon's nest in the western region, find the fellow Amayuri, Takiguri-san, find a bride, give birth to a lot of red and strong I will raise up to a child, strong one strong kids as long as I can catch another knight again. "

Unexpectedly, Amayuri lifted her head and licked Alice's lump.

Takiro got on the nose face on the right waist and sniffed the smell of the Eradrigue 's treasure instruments falling there.

Alpine ordered strongly as two brains released their heads.

"Go, come on! Do not look back, go straight on !!"

Come on!

The dragons raised their heads at the same time and they sang crowd.

When you make the giant stand up, start running in the direction of west straight without seeing behind. The widely spread wings plucked the wind in the desert, the fluffy and big body floated.

The brother and sister dragon fluttered strongly in the closeness that the tip of the wing touched, and took altitude at once.

And there ——.

Amayuri turned the long neck back.

A beautiful eyes like a crystal of love dragon saw Alice straight. A large droplet gathered at the edge, shining brilliantly and scattered in the sky.

"Ama...... yuri ...?"

Alice 's dazzle has not ended.

Flying dragon who returned the head direction and his elder brother, tilted the body to the right and turned direction at a sharp angle. It roars a violent roar and rises straight in line with the northern sky instead of the west. Aiming for a black pursuer, which is getting close enough to be clearly visible.

"No, no ... No Amayuri, no good!"

Alice screamed and ran.

However, the desert fine sand entangled in the boots.

At the end of the line of sight of Alice who fell down with his hands, Amayuri and Takiguri rushed to the high altitude that the immortal enemies awaited.

Silver scales shine like flames with red sunlight.

The sharp tusk - like doves open all the way.

As soon as the pursuer entered the range, Brothers and Sister dragons launched hot weapons, the largest weapon. The pure white light that penetrated the sky seemed as if the dragon's life itself was burning.

The enemy who rides on the back of a monster did not try to change the flight trajectory as if looking at the approaching ultra-high temperature flame.

Stretch the left hand casually, spread the five fingers.

_It can not be prevented. Flying dragon is the highest priority attack in this world except for the complete arms control of integrity knights and the multi-operation type by group of high-level operators. And there are two of them. In such a short time, he can not afford to cast a counterprotective technique._

So Alice speculated.

However.

Two heat rays that resonate the sharp resonance sound, it seemed to swallow enemy's body and burnt up, just before that. A bizarre phenomenon occurred beyond Alice 's understanding.

With the left hand of the tracer as the center, the jet black darkness swirled and spread.

The surrounding space distorted as though it were falling down to the dark. Even the heat rays of the flying dragon, which should include the tremendous power, were no exception. A straight trajectory draws an arc and is sucked as it is to the man 's left hand.

Just scattering small light, no flash and no explosion, 2 heat rays were as swallowed.

Alice surely saw a thin smile on the mouth of an enemy that was only a black dot, flying high heights that none of the art and sword skills could reach.

Immediately after.

Along with the harsh sound like grinding the sand, from the darkness of the man 's left hand, the jet black lightning crushed a few lines.

Swallowing the heat rays of the dragons and attacking as if it had spit out into my own power, that attack attacked the Amayori wings and limbs of the Takiguri without mercy. The head of the head swayed sharply, and still more brilliant blood than the red sky suffered in the air.

"Ah……"

Alice pant pants, yelling out to the sky with two hands.

"Amayori ......! Run away! Alright, please run away ......!"

Screams were surely delivered to the dragons. But two head dragons struck the wings as if they were struck by listening to Alice 's voice and rushed again.

Mouth is opened wide. An enthusiasm like hot air rises from the gap of the fangs, white light twinkles irregularly. Zu~ba~tsu!!

The heat ray burned the sky again.

Again, the man developed a shield of darkness and received a flame.

Although it was obvious that the same counterattacks as before came, the dragons boldly continued their assault. While continuing to emit light from the snouts, the wings are furiously flapping and thrusting towards the enemy.

Blood splashed from the wounds in two bodies changed into a flame. Silver scales detached one after another and became light grains and danced in the sky.

The existence of the dragons themselves is transformed into light.

Heat rays that continue to be released with burning life will fill the black vortex and begin to saturate. Whether it could not resist the raging enthusiasm, white smoke rose from the man's left hand.

But — that time.

The whole body of the enemy was enveloped in the beige of blue-black darkness. The vortex of emptiness emanating from the left hand also gained momentum, and immediately after that, the black lightning struck from the center pushed back the white heat rays.

The conflicting white and black forces competed for only one second between the two and reversed reluctantly. Numerous black lightning jumps in Amayori and Takiguri that relaxes the momentum of the wing as it is exhausted.

"Amayori! Ama .. yori....(gasp)!!"

It was that moment when Alice's scream spread to desert air with tears.

A star fell.

From the red sky, two sparkling lights fall at a terrible rate.

One aim aimed at the ground as it is.

And the other stopped perfectly at the middle point between the dragons and the pursuer. The light scattered at once, revealing the figure of what was hidden inside it.

_Human._

_He is a swordsman._

A black hair with a slightly longer length and a coat of black jet turns into the wind. On the back is a long sword of black and white that is equipped in a crossing shape. He combines his arms in front of his chest and is staring at the dark shadow of thunderstorms approaching.

Bang !! Bashitsu !!

The lightning struck the swordsman with the impulsive sound. No, exactly it was played without touching. Just before the swordsmen standing in the air with his arms folded, the thunder was obstructed by an invisible barrier, spreading power in vain.

Alice stopped breathing and opened his eyes a lot.

A swordsman in black dress looked around and saw Alice on the ground.

The face with little juvenile disappears small, the black eyes have a strong sparkle. Alice felt the spark scattering in the back of her chest. That fever expanded instantaneously and made the heart burn violently.

While conscious of new tears overflowing from both eyes, Alice got dizzy.

"Kiri ...... to ..."

A swordsman awakened from a long sleep for six months is powerful, but when he nods with a smiling smile somewhere, he reversed his body and raised his right hand straight.

Beyond that hand, the dying dragons are winging their wings with their last power. The ends of the wings and the tail of the long tail are already erasing as they melt in the light.

When the Amayori saw Kirito who lived together in a hut in the outskirts of Rulid village for half a year, it cried a little while.

Kirito also nodded and closed the eyelids.

Unexpectedly, the iridescent film covered the two dragons. It's as though it was wrapped in a huge soap bubble. But the dragons are not afraid, fold the wings, bend the neck, round the body a little.

The rainbow colored ball slowly descends Alice 's head.

A strange phenomenon occurred at Alice 's line of sight that forgets breathing and looks up.

Amayori and Takiguri split wearing the light of a color of seven colors are getting smaller as the milky side is seen. No, like young, I seemed to get older.

Small claws are rounded. The thick silver scales are replaced by soft feathers. Both the tail and neck are shortened, and the smaller wings are covered with fluff.

The dragons were no more than fifty centimeters when they fell into the arms of the spread Alice. Takikuri wrapped in bluish white fur seems to be asleep as soon as he closes his eyes.

And Amayori that went back to the same appearance as when I first met in Central • Cathedral like a greenish fluff ball looked straight up to Alice and opened a row in which pearl-like teeth are lined and a short voice.

"Ki-yuru!"

"Ama...yori..."

Through the murmur Alice 's bowl, the tears fell down, glittering with the dragon' s feathers fluttering.

Immediately after, the rainbow-colored light which envelops the two head dragons, increased its strength at once. The feeling transmitted to Alice's arm changes from softness of the feather to smooth hardness. When I blinked over and over, there were two big eggs in my arms.

Silver-colored eggs steadily got smaller and eventually erased the shining colors of the seven colors until finally lined up in the palm.

Alice put his head on two small eggs and speculated on the meaning of this phenomenon. Kirito judged that the Amayori and Takiguri bodies can not fully recover from the enormous amount of its maximum value, Kirito will reduce the upper limit itself to the limit - in other words, by reducing it to eggs, It has escaped.

I can not even imagine Alice, who should be the world's finest sacred craft, now what kind of technique can be used to realize that effect, but I did not feel uneasy. Someday I can see the dragons again, only such conviction has warmly spread to my heart.

Gently wrapped the two eggs with both hands, and Alice looked up at the sky again.

"Thank you and welcome back, Kirito"

Whisper with a tear-crying voice.

It was not supposed to reach the far higher sky, but the shadows of the black clothes firmly nodded and smiled again.

I heard a nostalgic voice in my ear.

<<Long and worrisome time it was. Thank you, Alice.>>

<<Let's meet the next time in Real World.>>

And Kirito turned his body slowly and opposed the pursuer who dressed in darkness.

I could not resist the intentions of both of them, I can play an intermittent spark in the empty space.

"... ... Kirito ..."

_The enemy, even you, you can not defeat by an ordinary attack._

Alice was so concerned and shrugged her lips.

And, suddenly she heard a voice from behind.

"All right, Alice-san."

When turning around, there was a real-world girl wearing herself in pearl-colored equipment, standing there.

"Asuna ..."

Asuna smiled while touching long brown hair in the wind, touching Alice's back.

"Let's believe in Kirito, we have to hurry to the World End Altar."

"Yeah ... ...."

Although he nodded, it is not so easy now.

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0148.jpg)

Alice turned to the south, looked up at the "end wall of the world" which stands from the far horizon and the white floating island floating in front of it.

"...... I think that the altar at the end is probably on the floating island, but I can not get on with the dragons already, how can I get to such a high place ..."

"Okay, leave it to me"

Asuna nodded, she pulled out a brilliant fine sword from her lower back.

Direct it straight ahead to the floating islands of the other side, face down the long eyelashes.

Suddenly, the singing of the angel heard even when the dark armed forces of the night last night reverberated with La. 

The light of the seven colors falls from the sky to the gray desert in a straight line.

Along with the heavy sound, a white lithograph floated up from the sand just in front of me.

Gon, go-go-go-gon!

Sounds echo in a sudden manner, a little more height is increased, another one, and one more litho appears.

A staircase of white stone appeared before the eyes of breathtaking Alice and the time taken for the floating islands over the sky was only ten seconds.

After finishing terrain manipulation, Asuna who unleashed the sword gave a knee to the sand and the gulp.

"Oh, Asuna ...... !!"

"Hur ... ... Let's hurry ... until the altar is shut down, it's only about eight more minutes ..."

_Shut down……?_

Alice did not understand the meaning of the word, but before he asked, his right hand was shrugged. Rising, hand was pulled by Asuna who started rising white stone steps, and Alice also ran. While running, I looked back at the black sword fighter who confronts the pursuer with the sky behind, turning around only once.

_Kirito. There are a lot of things you want to say and want to hear in you.  
Absolutely win. Win it, and come back in front of me._

***

The appearance of the floating staircase leading to the gray desert and the two female swordsmen who are running up at a speed that fly above it are seductively beautiful, poetic and symbolic .

I burned that sight to my mind and glared at the back of my chest.

_Alice. Asuna.  
With this ... ... It is a farewell._

To Asuna, I did not tell that I  ten minutes acceleration will reach 5 million times as much as reality, and if I can not escape, I must spend 200 years in this world. There is a reason.

Knowing that, it is because Asuna and Alice are about to fight with me. Even if it can not escape by the time limit because of that.

The moment I perceived the details of the enemy following Alice, I shuddered at the heterogeneity.

No, expressions like details are not suitable. Because there is no, there is only it. A black hole that swallows any information and does not escape even a single light.

The possibility of being able to escape safely with all of the kneelers is very low, destroying such opponent by the time limit. Then, my action priorities are nominated.

_Secure the log out of Asuna and Alice from the underworld.  
There is no priority other than that. None._

I firmly memorized a beautiful sight in memory as one picture, changed the face direction and saw the figure of the enemy hovering in front.

At last the encounter "it" was a completely unrecognized entity.

It is a man. That is probably certain.

However, it only understands.

If facial features are made by your own avatar, you probably intended "the average appearance of white men". Although it is in order, there is not any characteristic element. However, it can only be said that the skin is white, the eyes are blue, and the hair is gold.

The physique is also ordinary as a white species. Military jealousy clothes are wrapping bodies that are not fat or naughty. So if this man is a soldier, that is not sure either. Because black and gray camouflage painted on the top and bottom of the Jatcat is constantly moving around like a kind of mucus. Moreover, on the left waist is equipped with a long sword considered as a sacred grade.

I heard from Asuna that this guy is a member of the special forces that attacked Ocean Turtle during the move. Then, it should be a mercenary hired by money to organizations and businesses who wanted to capture human 's Fluctlight related technology. However, from a place that is a little far away, I can hardly believe that a man watching me with twinning like glass is such a realistic interest. No, I do not even feel it like being human in the first place.

After observing and thinking about one second, I opened mouth.

"... ... Who are you?"

The answer returned instantly. A smooth, but somewhat metallic sounding voice, the man said.

"I'm asking, stealing, robbing you."

As soon as the aura of the blue-black horse surrounding the whole body of a man increased the momentum of peristalsis. I feel a breeze blowing from behind. Air ... ... No, information constituting the world is being sucked into the darkness.

"What do you want?"

"Soul"

As you answer questions, the suction power also increases. It is not just world information. My consciousness itself also feels being pulled by the empty gravity.

And, suddenly I found something irritated on the man 's mouth. A smile that is irrelevant to emotion, a rarest smile: "Who are you, why are you there, what rights do you stand in front of me?"

_I am - someone?_

_The brave who descended to underworld? —— No way.  
Knight who guards the human world? —— No._

Every time I have a negative word on my mind, I feel something is being sucked out of me and being deprived. But for some reason I can not stop thinking.

_A hero who cleared Death Game SAO? —— No.  
The strongest VRMMO player? —— No.  
"Black swordsman"? "Two swords"? —— No, no.  
None of them are the ones I wanted.  
Then, who am I ... ...?_

Suddenly, that moment when consciousness faded.

I felt that someone's nostalgic voice called the name.

I gently picked up the face I had been falling down unnoticed and caught on as it was called.

"I am Kirito, swordsman Kirito"

Ba~chitsu!

White sparks burst and cut off the dark tentacles I was about to keep on me. Thoughts instantly regain clarity.

_What on earth is the phenomenon anyway?  
May this man directly interfere with this consciousness through the two STLs?_

While firmly sticking the barrier of the magic, staring at the man's eyes. It is very empty that there is there. Sucks off the hearts of others, the bottomless darkness.

"... Your name is"

I was asking so unconsciously.

A man thought slightly, he said.

"Gabriel. My name is Gabriel Miller."

I intuitively perceived that it is not the character name or the handle name but the real name of a man.

Because the appearance has changed for only a few seconds. The eyes get dull and it gets water ruthless. The lips are thin and tight, and the gills are scraped.

At the same time as returning to the original make-up face, the aura of the darkness spewing from the whole body of a man increased thickness at once.

At this stage, I finally noticed that the man's right arm was missing from the shoulders. The ambiguous darkness that I had wandered like my arms extended as I wandered and grasped the left waist sword.

The sword pulled out with a damp sound did not have a real blade.

Only the empty darkness rises like a black flame with a length of about one meter. Indeed, it is existence of absence.

The sword of the darkness held by the arms of the shadow, the man cut off with a bizarre tremor sound.

I pulled out the double sword at the back while taking a slight distance. The sword of blue rose on the left. And on the right hand, the sword of the night sky.

If it is a dark color, the sword of the night sky that shaved out from the Gigas Cedar's shoulder is also not defeated. However, while the blade reflects light like a black crystal, the man's sword is as black as if the space had just been cut off. It is not a level such as PoH 's friend knives and the same resource absorption attribute.

But no matter how unfamiliar it is, there is no way backward. Because it is necessary to stop this enemy until Asuna and Alice finish climbing the stairs several hundred meters high.

"......Let’s go, Gabriel!!"

Daringly shouting the name of the enemy, I flapped the hem of the cloak that transformed the wings.

While crossing at once, cross the two swords in front of the body.

"Generate • All • Element!"

When I generated dozens of predispositions of all attributes due to the surrounding space itself as a terminal, I shoot them all at the same time with a sudden drop.

"Discharge!!"

Arrow of fire, water spear, wind blade, and many other colors run through the air.

Sprinkle the left and right sword to follow the sacred art.

Gabriel Miller did not take any avoidance action.

While laughing, just spread your hands on the spot.

Eight colors of light pierce the body that wears the blue darkness.

I did not miss the gap that slightly wobbled the upper body, I got off the man's torso with the right handed sword and pierced his breast with my left handed sword. Mucous darkness scatters, leaving cold air on my skin that makes me pass.

Flight as it is, take distance and turn around quickly.

My eyes were widened.

When I dragged the darkness that flowed out into irregular shapes, I pulled back and it was the appearance of Gabriel turning around to not have anything. There is no scar on the Jacquard wrapping the body.

Also.

Attribution of that man is absorbed against slashing, piercing, flames, freezing, whirlwind, water bullets, steel arrows, crystal blades, light rays and dark curse.

The moment of crossing, from my right shoulder that has been stroked to the edge of nothingness, the fabric and flesh of coat disappears to be gouged, fresh blood is splattered.

***

Gabriel Miller got a glimpse of the appearance of Alice and another girl who is going up a pure white aerial staircase, and the remaining time until they reach the system console is five minutes. Estimated.

Then, he can not afford to be caught in a battle with a disturbing person who appeared abruptly. It will be a logical decision to instantly neutralize and take express to floating island. But Gabriel kept staying on the spot with just a few interests in his new enemies.

_At first glance, it looks like just a child._

Compared to a master fencer who fought ahead and became a partner, it is equal to without intimidating feeling. Perhaps, like "Shinon", it is a Japanese VRMMO player who is cooperating with RATH, but even that girl is inferior in terms of pressure.

Because black hairy young people do not release much of the fighting spirit.

Only at that moment when I asked someone, I was able to suck up my mind slightly, but that circuit was immediately shut off. After that, it keeps playing the tentacles of Gabriel's spirit as if it were wrapped in a transparent shell. Even if you fight an enemy who can not enjoy your heart, it's not as fun as it is.

Then it immediately thought to eliminate immediately and pursue Alice.

But as soon as he saw the young man changing the hem of the long coat to wing shape and manipulating various magic of various attributes at the same time, my mind changed a little. It is because he felt that he was accustomed to this world.

After securing Alice and escaping to a third country with STL technology, work to build your own virtual world to suit everything is waiting. In order to do it efficiently, it is not bad to deprive the youth of the operating technique.

_For that, first of all, we need to destroy the shell of magic._

Gabriel spoke with a thin smile, to a Japanese boy in a black suit.

"I give you three minutes. Amuse me."

***

"... ... how generous."

I murmured with a stroke of my fingertips blocking the wound on my right shoulder.

But there is plenty of support for Gabriel Miller's margin. Anyway it's unbeatable against attacks of all attributes.

_No, only one, there will be no offensive attributes to pass. It was Shinon who was surely preceded that he blew his right arm. It was aiming for her love guns with imagination force to create a Hekata II and shoot through it. In other words, if you attack the "shoot" attribute, you can not absorb Gabriels._

The reason is that it is not unrelated to the fact that he is in the form of a military jacket in its entirety. Through experience in the real world I knew the power of the objective sniper rifle, but maybe I could not cancel the damage when I was shot by the will.

However, this departure, such as embodying firearms with this underworld, was possible because Shinon handles the guns as hands and feet. I can not imitate it very much, even if I was able to create one handgun, very much power is not involved.

In other words, in addition to the shooting attribute, I need to find out what something that bizarre man will recognize as damage.

That is to say, I know Gabriel the human being. You have to figure out how to live, what you want and why you are here.

I held the swords right and left and I smiled at the edge of my mouth.

"It will be nice, let me entertain you"

***

What on earth is the basis for that confidence?

It is certain that logging in to the underworld for a long time and being accustomed to the world system, but is not it a child of the game player at all? Why is it that you can laugh at all, even though you have just been told that all of the swords that you have set up exaggerated and all of the flashy magic attacks are helpless?

Gabriel thought that while feeling a slight discomfort to the attitude of a boy who would not show fear, he thought so, and concluded that he was brutal for earning time.

Even if it dies in this world, it does not hurt any wounds to the physical body of reality.
