## Part 2

_He catches up._

Alice looking backwards on the saddle of the Amayuri shaved small lips.

The ominous black spots floating in the red sky are definitely larger than five minutes ago. Not the speed of the enemy increased, but the Amayuri and Takiguri are finally running out.

Naturally it is close to a miracle that she worked hard so far rather than to say - he kept flying without having to rest. From the central capital Centoria to the last mountain range, that is, a distance several times larger than the radius of the human world, we moved in a half day. Both heads are obviously continuing their marginal flight while intensely consuming our Life.

However, why do not those pursuers get exhausted as soon as?

It was confirmed by hyperopia with crystalloid, and seems to be on the back of a bizarre creature that is different from a dragon. I have never seen such creatures that only have to express as the wing 's raw disk, even in the human world as well as in the dark territory.

The archer, named Shinon, who came from the same "real world" as Kirito was saying. The pursuer is the dark territory emperor and the dark god Vector himself, his identity is a real world person in a position to hostile against Kirito and Shinon.

Emperor Vector once lost to the knight's sword of Bercouli - possibly the sacred treasure time sword release recollection technique. But with the new life he got down to this place again and chased Alice.

The anger that you can not forgive a bullshit "resuscitation" that ridicule the death of Bell Couri never vanishes.

But Alice found something to be done during a single flight.

If an enemy is said to be immortal in this world ——.

Before we kill it in real world.

For that reason, at any rate, we reach the "altar of the end".

Returning the line of sight to the front, it seems a little strange that cliffs of irreconcilable size climb up far beyond the red sky. It is a "wall of the end of the world" transmitted to Genesis myths. Unlike the mountain ranges of the human world that can be crossed over by the dragon, that cliff that surrounds the dark territory continues to infinite heights.

Before the cliff, nearly as high as Alice flies.

Only one small floating island is drifting.

It is impossible to guess what island that is shaped like a sharp cup at the bottom is floating in the empty space with any force.

As you close your eyes you can see some artificial structures in the center of the flat upper surface. It is probably the "altar of the end" that aims for. As the exit of the world, the entrance to Real World.

The remaining distance is cut off by 10 kiloliters, but unfortunately it will be slightly faster for Emperor Vector to catch up behind Alice than to arrive at the Alter.

Alice slowly breathed in and breathed.

Gently stroke the neck of love dragon with your right hand and order.

"Thank you for everything, Amayuri and Takiguri at the end so far, you should descend to the ground"

Two heads crowed with a weak voice, entered a spiral descent while lined up.

The underlying terrain has changed a bit ago into a cold dark gray desert. While drawing a long trajectory in the desert and continuing sand of the sea as if God got tired of the creation, the dragons landed halfway down.

Altering quickly jumped from the back of Amayuri that leaves the giant leaking voice from the back of the throat. Exploring the waist bag and taking out a small bottle of the remaining spirit remained.

Pour half of the blue liquid into the Amayuri's mouth that has become half open and pour the rest one drop into the mouth of the next brother dragon. Although it is a spirit made by an axiomatic church, it is totally insufficient to heal the enormous Life of the flying dragon, but still the power to take off once more should return.

Alice gently shriveled the under chin of the dragon's woolen hair with the left and right hands.

"Amayuri, Takiguri"

As soon as I called, tears floated in nature and both eyes. Continue it hard, keep on.

"Here is a farewell, the last command ... ... Fly to the human world, return to the dragon's nest in the western region, find the fellow Amayuri, Takiguri-san, find a bride, give birth to a lot of red and strong I will raise up to a child, strong one strong kids as long as I can catch another knight again. "

Unexpectedly, Amayuri lifted her head and licked Alice's lump.

Takiro got on the nose face on the right waist and sniffed the smell of the Eradrigue 's treasure instruments falling there.

Alpine ordered strongly as two brains released their heads.

"Go, come on! Do not look back, go straight on !!"

Come on!

The dragons raised their heads at the same time and they sang crowd.

When you make the giant stand up, start running in the direction of west straight without seeing behind. The widely spread wings plucked the wind in the desert, the fluffy and big body floated.

The brother and sister dragon fluttered strongly in the closeness that the tip of the wing touched, and took altitude at once.

And there ——.

Amayuri turned the long neck back.

A beautiful eyes like a crystal of love dragon saw Alice straight. A large droplet gathered at the edge, shining brilliantly and scattered in the sky.

"Ama...... yuri ...?"

Alice 's dazzle has not ended.

Flying dragon who returned the head direction and his elder brother, tilted the body to the right and turned direction at a sharp angle. It roars a violent roar and rises straight in line with the northern sky instead of the west. Aiming for a black pursuer, which is getting close enough to be clearly visible.

"No, no ... No Amayuri, no good!"

Alice screamed and ran.

However, the desert fine sand entangled in the boots.

At the end of the line of sight of Alice who fell down with his hands, Amayuri and Takiguri rushed to the high altitude that the immortal enemies awaited.

Silver scales shine like flames with red sunlight.

The sharp tusk - like doves open all the way.

As soon as the pursuer entered the range, Brothers and Sister dragons launched hot weapons, the largest weapon. The pure white light that penetrated the sky seemed as if the dragon's life itself was burning.

The enemy who rides on the back of a monster did not try to change the flight trajectory as if looking at the approaching ultra-high temperature flame.

Stretch the left hand casually, spread the five fingers.

_It can not be prevented. Flying dragon is the highest priority attack in this world except for the complete arms control of integrity knights and the multi-operation type by group of high-level operators. And there are two of them. In such a short time, he can not afford to cast a counterprotective technique._

So Alice speculated.

However.

Two heat rays that resonate the sharp resonance sound, it seemed to swallow enemy's body and burnt up, just before that. A bizarre phenomenon occurred beyond Alice 's understanding.

With the left hand of the tracer as the center, the jet black darkness swirled and spread.

The surrounding space distorted as though it were falling down to the dark. Even the heat rays of the flying dragon, which should include the tremendous power, were no exception. A straight trajectory draws an arc and is sucked as it is to the man 's left hand.

Just scattering small light, no flash and no explosion, 2 heat rays were as swallowed.

Alice surely saw a thin smile on the mouth of an enemy that was only a black dot, flying high heights that none of the art and sword skills could reach.

Immediately after.

Along with the harsh sound like grinding the sand, from the darkness of the man 's left hand, the jet black lightning crushed a few lines.

Swallowing the heat rays of the dragons and attacking as if it had spit out into my own power, that attack attacked the Amayori wings and limbs of the Takiguri without mercy. The head of the head swayed sharply, and still more brilliant blood than the red sky suffered in the air.

"Ah……"

Alice pant pants, yelling out to the sky with two hands.

"Amayori ......! Run away! Alright, please run away ......!"

Screams were surely delivered to the dragons. But two head dragons struck the wings as if they were struck by listening to Alice 's voice and rushed again.

Mouth is opened wide. An enthusiasm like hot air rises from the gap of the fangs, white light twinkles irregularly. Zu~ba~tsu!!

The heat ray burned the sky again.

Again, the man developed a shield of darkness and received a flame.

Although it was obvious that the same counterattacks as before came, the dragons boldly continued their assault. While continuing to emit light from the snouts, the wings are furiously flapping and thrusting towards the enemy.

Blood splashed from the wounds in two bodies changed into a flame. Silver scales detached one after another and became light grains and danced in the sky.

The existence of the dragons themselves is transformed into light.

Heat rays that continue to be released with burning life will fill the black vortex and begin to saturate. Whether it could not resist the raging enthusiasm, white smoke rose from the man's left hand.

But — that time.

The whole body of the enemy was enveloped in the beige of blue-black darkness. The vortex of emptiness emanating from the left hand also gained momentum, and immediately after that, the black lightning struck from the center pushed back the white heat rays.

The conflicting white and black forces competed for only one second between the two and reversed reluctantly. Numerous black lightning jumps in Amayori and Takiguri that relaxes the momentum of the wing as it is exhausted.

"Amayori! Ama .. yori....(gasp)!!"

It was that moment when Alice's scream spread to desert air with tears.

A star fell.

From the red sky, two sparkling lights fall at a terrible rate.

One aim aimed at the ground as it is.

And the other stopped perfectly at the middle point between the dragons and the pursuer. The light scattered at once, revealing the figure of what was hidden inside it.

_Human._

_He is a swordsman._

A black hair with a slightly longer length and a coat of black jet turns into the wind. On the back is a long sword of black and white that is equipped in a crossing shape. He combines his arms in front of his chest and is staring at the dark shadow of thunderstorms approaching.

Bang !! Bashitsu !!

The lightning struck the swordsman with the impulsive sound. No, exactly it was played without touching. Just before the swordsmen standing in the air with his arms folded, the thunder was obstructed by an invisible barrier, spreading power in vain.

Alice stopped breathing and opened his eyes a lot.

A swordsman in black dress looked around and saw Alice on the ground.

The face with little juvenile disappears small, the black eyes have a strong sparkle. Alice felt the spark scattering in the back of her chest. That fever expanded instantaneously and made the heart burn violently.

While conscious of new tears overflowing from both eyes, Alice got dizzy.

"Kiri ...... to ..."

A swordsman awakened from a long sleep for six months is powerful, but when he nods with a smiling smile somewhere, he reversed his body and raised his right hand straight.

Beyond that hand, the dying dragons are winging their wings with their last power. The ends of the wings and the tail of the long tail are already erasing as they melt in the light.

When the Amayori saw Kirito who lived together in a hut in the outskirts of Rulid village for half a year, it cried a little while.

Kirito also nodded and closed the eyelids.

Unexpectedly, the iridescent film covered the two dragons. It's as though it was wrapped in a huge soap bubble. But the dragons are not afraid, fold the wings, bend the neck, round the body a little.

The rainbow colored ball slowly descends Alice 's head.

A strange phenomenon occurred at Alice 's line of sight that forgets breathing and looks up.

Amayori and Takiguri split wearing the light of a color of seven colors are getting smaller as the milky side is seen. No, like young, I seemed to get older.

Small claws are rounded. The thick silver scales are replaced by soft feathers. Both the tail and neck are shortened, and the smaller wings are covered with fluff.

The dragons were no more than fifty centimeters when they fell into the arms of the spread Alice. Takikuri wrapped in bluish white fur seems to be asleep as soon as he closes his eyes.

And Amayori that went back to the same appearance as when I first met in Central • Cathedral like a greenish fluff ball looked straight up to Alice and opened a row in which pearl-like teeth are lined and a short voice.

"Ki-yuru!"

"Ama...yori..."

Through the murmur Alice 's bowl, the tears fell down, glittering with the dragon' s feathers fluttering.

Immediately after, the rainbow-colored light which envelops the two head dragons, increased its strength at once. The feeling transmitted to Alice's arm changes from softness of the feather to smooth hardness. When I blinked over and over, there were two big eggs in my arms.

Silver-colored eggs steadily got smaller and eventually erased the shining colors of the seven colors until finally lined up in the palm.

Alice put his head on two small eggs and speculated on the meaning of this phenomenon. Kirito judged that the Amayori and Takiguri bodies can not fully recover from the enormous amount of its maximum value, Kirito will reduce the upper limit itself to the limit - in other words, by reducing it to eggs, It has escaped.

I can not even imagine Alice, who should be the world's finest sacred craft, now what kind of technique can be used to realize that effect, but I did not feel uneasy. Someday I can see the dragons again, only such conviction has warmly spread to my heart.

Gently wrapped the two eggs with both hands, and Alice looked up at the sky again.

"Thank you and welcome back, Kirito"

Whisper with a tear-crying voice.

It was not supposed to reach the far higher sky, but the shadows of the black clothes firmly nodded and smiled again.

I heard a nostalgic voice in my ear.

<<Long and worrisome time it was. Thank you, Alice.>>

<<Let's meet the next time in Real World.>>

And Kirito turned his body slowly and opposed the pursuer who dressed in darkness.

I could not resist the intentions of both of them, I can play an intermittent spark in the empty space.

"... ... Kirito ..."

_The enemy, even you, you can not defeat by an ordinary attack._

Alice was so concerned and shrugged her lips.

And, suddenly she heard a voice from behind.

"All right, Alice-san."

When turning around, there was a real-world girl wearing herself in pearl-colored equipment, standing there.

"Asuna ..."

Asuna smiled while touching long brown hair in the wind, touching Alice's back.

"Let's believe in Kirito, we have to hurry to the World End Altar."

"Yeah ... ...."

Although he nodded, it is not so easy now.

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0148.jpg)

Alice turned to the south, looked up at the "end wall of the world" which stands from the far horizon and the white floating island floating in front of it.

"...... I think that the altar at the end is probably on the floating island, but I can not get on with the dragons already, how can I get to such a high place ..."

"Okay, leave it to me"

Asuna nodded, she pulled out a brilliant fine sword from her lower back.

Direct it straight ahead to the floating islands of the other side, face down the long eyelashes.

Suddenly, the singing of the angel heard even when the dark armed forces of the night last night reverberated with La. 

The light of the seven colors falls from the sky to the gray desert in a straight line.

Along with the heavy sound, a white lithograph floated up from the sand just in front of me.

Gon, go-go-go-gon!

Sounds echo in a sudden manner, a little more height is increased, another one, and one more litho appears.

A staircase of white stone appeared before the eyes of breathtaking Alice and the time taken for the floating islands over the sky was only ten seconds.

After finishing terrain manipulation, Asuna who unleashed the sword gave a knee to the sand and the gulp.

"Oh, Asuna ...... !!"

"Hur ... ... Let's hurry ... until the altar is shut down, it's only about eight more minutes ..."

_Shut down……?_

Alice did not understand the meaning of the word, but before he asked, his right hand was shrugged. Rising, hand was pulled by Asuna who started rising white stone steps, and Alice also ran. While running, I looked back at the black sword fighter who confronts the pursuer with the sky behind, turning around only once.

_Kirito. There are a lot of things you want to say and want to hear in you.  
Absolutely win. Win it, and come back in front of me._

***

The appearance of the floating staircase leading to the gray desert and the two female swordsmen who are running up at a speed that fly above it are seductively beautiful, poetic and symbolic .

I burned that sight to my mind and glared at the back of my chest.

_Alice. Asuna.  
With this ... ... It is a farewell._

To Asuna, I did not tell that I  ten minutes acceleration will reach 5 million times as much as reality, and if I can not escape, I must spend 200 years in this world. There is a reason.

Knowing that, it is because Asuna and Alice are about to fight with me. Even if it can not escape by the time limit because of that.

The moment I perceived the details of the enemy following Alice, I shuddered at the heterogeneity.

No, expressions like details are not suitable. Because there is no, there is only it. A black hole that swallows any information and does not escape even a single light.

The possibility of being able to escape safely with all of the kneelers is very low, destroying such opponent by the time limit. Then, my action priorities are nominated.

_Secure the log out of Asuna and Alice from the underworld.  
There is no priority other than that. None._

I firmly memorized a beautiful sight in memory as one picture, changed the face direction and saw the figure of the enemy hovering in front.

At last the encounter "it" was a completely unrecognized entity.

It is a man. That is probably certain.

However, it only understands.

If facial features are made by your own avatar, you probably intended "the average appearance of white men". Although it is in order, there is not any characteristic element. However, it can only be said that the skin is white, the eyes are blue, and the hair is gold.

The physique is also ordinary as a white species. Military jealousy clothes are wrapping bodies that are not fat or naughty. So if this man is a soldier, that is not sure either. Because black and gray camouflage painted on the top and bottom of the Jatcat is constantly moving around like a kind of mucus. Moreover, on the left waist is equipped with a long sword considered as a sacred grade.

I heard from Asuna that this guy is a member of the special forces that attacked Ocean Turtle during the move. Then, it should be a mercenary hired by money to organizations and businesses who wanted to capture human 's Fluctlight related technology. However, from a place that is a little far away, I can hardly believe that a man watching me with twinning like glass is such a realistic interest. No, I do not even feel it like being human in the first place.

After observing and thinking about one second, I opened mouth.

"... ... Who are you?"

The answer returned instantly. A smooth, but somewhat metallic sounding voice, the man said.

"I'm asking, stealing, robbing you."

As soon as the aura of the blue-black horse surrounding the whole body of a man increased the momentum of peristalsis. I feel a breeze blowing from behind. Air ... ... No, information constituting the world is being sucked into the darkness.

"What do you want?"

"Soul"

As you answer questions, the suction power also increases. It is not just world information. My consciousness itself also feels being pulled by the empty gravity.

And, suddenly I found something irritated on the man 's mouth. A smile that is irrelevant to emotion, a rarest smile: "Who are you, why are you there, what rights do you stand in front of me?"

_I am - someone?_

_The brave who descended to underworld? —— No way.  
Knight who guards the human world? —— No._

Every time I have a negative word on my mind, I feel something is being sucked out of me and being deprived. But for some reason I can not stop thinking.

_A hero who cleared Death Game SAO? —— No.  
The strongest VRMMO player? —— No.  
"Black swordsman"? "Two swords"? —— No, no.  
None of them are the ones I wanted.  
Then, who am I ... ...?_

Suddenly, that moment when consciousness faded.

I felt that someone's nostalgic voice called the name.

I gently picked up the face I had been falling down unnoticed and caught on as it was called.

"I am Kirito, swordsman Kirito"

Ba~chitsu!

White sparks burst and cut off the dark tentacles I was about to keep on me. Thoughts instantly regain clarity.

_What on earth is the phenomenon anyway?  
May this man directly interfere with this consciousness through the two STLs?_

While firmly sticking the barrier of the magic, staring at the man's eyes. It is very empty that there is there. Sucks off the hearts of others, the bottomless darkness.

"... Your name is"

I was asking so unconsciously.

A man thought slightly, he said.

"Gabriel. My name is Gabriel Miller."

I intuitively perceived that it is not the character name or the handle name but the real name of a man.

Because the appearance has changed for only a few seconds. The eyes get dull and it gets water ruthless. The lips are thin and tight, and the gills are scraped.

At the same time as returning to the original make-up face, the aura of the darkness spewing from the whole body of a man increased thickness at once.

At this stage, I finally noticed that the man's right arm was missing from the shoulders. The ambiguous darkness that I had wandered like my arms extended as I wandered and grasped the left waist sword.

The sword pulled out with a damp sound did not have a real blade.

Only the empty darkness rises like a black flame with a length of about one meter. Indeed, it is existence of absence.

The sword of the darkness held by the arms of the shadow, the man cut off with a bizarre tremor sound.

I pulled out the double sword at the back while taking a slight distance. The sword of blue rose on the left. And on the right hand, the sword of the night sky.

If it is a dark color, the sword of the night sky that shaved out from the Gigas Cedar's shoulder is also not defeated. However, while the blade reflects light like a black crystal, the man's sword is as black as if the space had just been cut off. It is not a level such as PoH 's friend knives and the same resource absorption attribute.

But no matter how unfamiliar it is, there is no way backward. Because it is necessary to stop this enemy until Asuna and Alice finish climbing the stairs several hundred meters high.

"......Let’s go, Gabriel!!"

Daringly shouting the name of the enemy, I flapped the hem of the cloak that transformed the wings.

While crossing at once, cross the two swords in front of the body.

"Generate • All • Element!"

When I generated dozens of predispositions of all attributes due to the surrounding space itself as a terminal, I shoot them all at the same time with a sudden drop.

"Discharge!!"

Arrow of fire, water spear, wind blade, and many other colors run through the air.

Sprinkle the left and right sword to follow the sacred art.

Gabriel Miller did not take any avoidance action.

While laughing, just spread your hands on the spot.

Eight colors of light pierce the body that wears the blue darkness.

I did not miss the gap that slightly wobbled the upper body, I got off the man's torso with the right handed sword and pierced his breast with my left handed sword. Mucous darkness scatters, leaving cold air on my skin that makes me pass.

Flight as it is, take distance and turn around quickly.

My eyes were widened.

When I dragged the darkness that flowed out into irregular shapes, I pulled back and it was the appearance of Gabriel turning around to not have anything. There is no scar on the Jacquard wrapping the body.

Also.

Attribution of that man is absorbed against slashing, piercing, flames, freezing, whirlwind, water bullets, steel arrows, crystal blades, light rays and dark curse.

The moment of crossing, from my right shoulder that has been stroked to the edge of nothingness, the fabric and flesh of coat disappears to be gouged, fresh blood is splattered.

***

Gabriel Miller got a glimpse of the appearance of Alice and another girl who is going up a pure white aerial staircase, and the remaining time until they reach the system console is five minutes. Estimated.

Then, he can not afford to be caught in a battle with a disturbing person who appeared abruptly. It will be a logical decision to instantly neutralize and take express to floating island. But Gabriel kept staying on the spot with just a few interests in his new enemies.

_At first glance, it looks like just a child._

Compared to a master fencer who fought ahead and became a partner, it is equal to without intimidating feeling. Perhaps, like "Shinon", it is a Japanese VRMMO player who is cooperating with RATH, but even that girl is inferior in terms of pressure.

Because black hairy young people do not release much of the fighting spirit.

Only at that moment when I asked someone, I was able to suck up my mind slightly, but that circuit was immediately shut off. After that, it keeps playing the tentacles of Gabriel's spirit as if it were wrapped in a transparent shell. Even if you fight an enemy who can not enjoy your heart, it's not as fun as it is.

Then it immediately thought to eliminate immediately and pursue Alice.

But as soon as he saw the young man changing the hem of the long coat to wing shape and manipulating various magic of various attributes at the same time, my mind changed a little. It is because he felt that he was accustomed to this world.

After securing Alice and escaping to a third country with STL technology, work to build your own virtual world to suit everything is waiting. In order to do it efficiently, it is not bad to deprive the youth of the operating technique.

_For that, first of all, we need to destroy the shell of magic._

Gabriel spoke with a thin smile, to a Japanese boy in a black suit.

"I give you three minutes. Amuse me."

***

"... ... how generous."

I murmured with a stroke of my fingertips blocking the wound on my right shoulder.

But there is plenty of support for Gabriel Miller's margin. Anyway it's unbeatable against attacks of all attributes.

_No, only one, there will be no offensive attributes to pass. It was Shinon who was surely preceded that he blew his right arm. It was aiming for her love guns with imagination force to create a Hekata II and shoot through it. In other words, if you attack the "shoot" attribute, you can not absorb Gabriels._

The reason is that it is not unrelated to the fact that he is in the form of a military jacket in its entirety. Through experience in the real world I knew the power of the objective sniper rifle, but maybe I could not cancel the damage when I was shot by the will.

However, this departure, such as embodying firearms with this underworld, was possible because Shinon handles the guns as hands and feet. I can not imitate it very much, even if I was able to create one handgun, very much power is not involved.

In other words, in addition to the shooting attribute, I need to find out what something that bizarre man will recognize as damage.

That is to say, I know Gabriel the human being. You have to figure out how to live, what you want and why you are here.

I held the swords right and left and I smiled at the edge of my mouth.

"It will be nice, let me entertain you"

***

_What on earth is the basis for that confidence?_

_It he certain that logging in to the underworld for a long time and being accustomed to the world system, becoming not it a child of the game player at all? Why is it that you can laugh at all, even though you have just been told that all of the swords that you have set up exaggerated and all of the flashy magic attacks are helpless?_

Gabriel thought that while feeling a slight discomfort to the attitude of a boy who would not show fear, he thought so, and concluded that he was brutal for earning time.

_Even if he dies in this world, it does not hurt any wounds to the physical body of reality._

_On top of that, I am thinking only to prolong the battle until a girl who would be a friend can secure Alice. After all it is a silly child. It is too long to go out with three minutes_.

Grabbing with a right hand that was built with will, swaying swaying blades swiftly - Gabriel casually stabbed it on the back of a winged creature that he rides.

Originally this monster, like a sword and a stone bow, the jetpack possessed by "Saturater" was replaced by this world at the time of convert. Although it can be controlled with intention, riding with both feet lacks sense of stability. For that boy, it is more rational to just use wings.

A monster skewered his back, suddenly being sucked into emptiness by simply screaming a short screaming quickly. Gabriel moved the data that flowed into the right arm through the sword to the back and focused his intention.

Besides the shoes, the black wings extended from the shoulder blade as well as that of the boy. But this is not a coat type of bat, but that of a bird of prey with sharp feathers. For myself with the name of an angel, this one is better.

"... ... you, I'll steal it"

Gabriel whispered coldly towards the youngster.

***

In the next attack, I thought that an enemy riding a disk-shaped flying organism was going to fall down, I was instantly struck and my decision power declined for a moment.

Gabriel slipped into the sword's gap, not missing the gap, and flaring the wings of the black bird of prey.

The speed of thrust technique delivered with no motion was surprising. As for sword tricks I was staring at an amateur, but nothing. Receive the two swords crossed to cross, to scoop up from below. Gutta Yuu!

And with a strange sound, the sword of blue-black darkness stopped at my nose.

Blue rose sword and night sky sword grudge. It is not barely eroded, but it is so to speak as a fight with emptiness itself. It is easy to imagine that a huge burden is placed on the sword.

However, it was a strategy that did not avoid in the backstep and dared to cross-block.

I did not resist the ability of Gabriel to slash the dark sword in a brute force, I let my body flow to the right and I got a whole body high kick.

"Ra !!"

With the spirit, the toe that jumped while pulling the orange light caught the sharp jaw. Both and darkness scatter, Gabriel rebels against the upper body.

_How can it be?_

I struck the air strongly with the wings and I took a distance with the back dash while I checked the state of the enemy. If it is a "blow", if it is a soldier of a special forces, even though it does not go to the shoot and even if it does not go up to it, there is a possibility of recognizing it as damage, since he will of course also undergo training of fighting technique.

Hell, Gabriel who returned his head, but was superficially innocent.

The black darkness which splattered from the jaw quickly agglutinated and regenerated smooth skin. While stroking with the left hand, the enemy laughed grinningly.

"I see, but unfortunately such a great skill is a substitute for show-up TV.

Real Martial•Arts ... "

Cut!!

And in the mid-word, Gabriel crawled in at such speed that the whole body was a flow of black. I played the sword swung down from the upper left in a reflexive manner with the sword of the blue rose and at the same time fired back with the sword of the night sky. The blade bites into the shoulder of the enemy, and it will not move with just how much it was wrapped in high concentration mucus.

There was something tangled to the right in my right arm, which grew. Gabriel's left arm. Wrapped around like a thick snake, the joint was immediately extradited.

Along with the unpleasant sounds, my brain stunned a severe pain similar to the current.

"Gu-a ... ...."

I peeped into the face of groaning me nearby, Gabriel whispered.

"—— is this."

Immediately after that, a furious rush was started.

The empty sword blows a continuous technique of the infinitely many times at ultra high speed. I managed to manage it with just the sword on my left hand, but the blow from the defense got me scooping around the body shallowly. There is no time to concentrate the spirit to restore the deflected right arm.

"Wow ... ... Oh ..."

I sprang out unconsciously, I made the wings strongly flapping to take a distance.

Just grasp the sword while rolling backward with full power and put my left hand fingers on the right arm.

White light gathered at that time.

Gabriel swept the left hand a bit and bent the five fingers like a claw, it opened at a stretch.

More than ten jet blackening spreading radially, bent at an acute angle on the way and attack it.

I tied up my teeth and developed barriers for imagination. When I played the same against technique that attacked Alice 's dragons, I had absolute certainty, but now the recognition itself that I devote half of my concentration to the treatment of my arm decreases the strength of the shield ——.

Dull vibration occurred in several parts of the body.

Three rays of darkness penetrating the barrier protected the torso and legs. Prior to pain, terrible coldness runs through sensations. Looking at it, blue-black emptiness sticks to the point where it penetrated, trying to eat my existence itself.

"Gu ...... !!"

While growl again, breathe in heavily and let out the breath. Finally the emptiness disappeared, but a large amount of fresh blood was scattered from a new wound.

"Ha ha ha"

When raising his face to a dry voice, Gabriel Miller was distorting a vague look and laughing.

"Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha"

No, this is not a laugh. Even though his lips are lifted, his eyes do not move at all, and only hunger is swirling in the eyes like a glass ball.

Gabriel crossed the arms slowly in front of the body and showed a gesture like gathering power.

The dark aura trembles heavily. It shakes violently like a flame, and it increases in thickness.

"Hah !!"

Along with intense spirit, arms opened wide

Zuck —— and two new black wings extended from the already existing wings and spread widely. Another pair from the bottom side.

Gabriel gradually increases in altitude, with huge wings of six in total, fluttering in order from the top. A jet black ring appears on top of it, camouflage clothing loses its shape and turns into a dark-colored thin cloth.

Either way, both eyes were not only those of people. In the eye socket, just only blue-black light is filled.

Just - an angel of death.

A transcendent who hunts and takes away the soul of a person. What kind of attacks do you want when you have such a soulophile?

I removed the line of sight from that appearance which embodied the fear, confirmed the appearance of Asuna and Alice running hands in the aerial staircase by holding hands. It's still half past half past. It will take two more minutes, three minutes to reach floating island.

I am not convinced already I can earn that much time.

***

Oh, what a sense of almighty.

Gabrielle laughed a third laughter at a very strong intensity of power running through the whole body.

Imagination in this world - This is the power of "mind" if you borrow the words of a master swordsman.

It is the same as that swordsman who slashed Gabriel back in time and the dark general who transformed into a giant tornado ... ... No, I finally got it. Gabriel had thought that their skills are based on unknown system commands, but it was not so. The point is, how strongly you can convince yourself. It was also because I noticed that the black-haired kid performed in front of me and demonstrated.

_In the sense of appreciation, I will give you only one more minute._

Gabriel widened the six wings wide and raised the sword of the dark at the highest.

In a minute, cut out the body of the boy, extract the soul and eat it. In order to make further power my mind.

While wearing a blue purple spark throughout the body, Gabriel entered into a charge attack.

***

I looked up at the figure of the enemy who was no longer a human.

I can not think of anything like that man who fears and perceives it to be a threat. As a proof that even shoots have become ineffective, the right arm, which should have been blown away by Shinon, is playing completely altogether.

In the end, it was insufficient.

I did not see Gabriel Miller sweet. That heterogeneous sign was worth the greatest vigilance. But that is why I may have given up victory, maybe before starting this fight. If you can earn even time —- that if you extend the fight until Alice and Asuna escape, I will be prisoned here in the time of two hundred years, so I will never come back to reality.

Oh, I see.

Perhaps I thought that I wanted it?

A true different world beyond Incrad. The ideal village that Kayaba Akihiko wanted and tried to create. The underworld is just right to call it.

I always asked myself whether I really wanted to escape for two years when I was caught by Death Game SAO. I kept fighting at the forefront as a member of the strategy group while hesitating because I had vaguely anticipated that there was a strict time limit in daily life in that world. Lying on the bed of a hospital, the living body that connects life only by drip will someday exceed the limit of weakness says.

However, there is not it in the underworld where time has been accelerated. If the magnification reaches 5 million times, it becomes unnecessary to think about the physical body in reality. I will stay in this different world until the life spirit of the soul runs out. Can we really assert that it did not think so unconsciously?

As a result ——

Suguha, mother, father.

Yui, Klein, Egil, Liz, Silica ... ... and many others who saved me. And Alice.

Asuna also.

Do not even think about how lament, sorrow tears flow.

After all, it is a human being who can truly know the person's heart.

From the time I abandoned my friend who asked for help when I was a junior high school student, nothing changed. 

_No, Kirito._

A nostalgic voice.

Frozen like ice Left hand on the left, faint warmth.

_If you think that you do not want to leave this world, that is not for yourself. It is because you love the people you met here.  
Selca, Tiese, Ronie, Rina-sempai, people of Rulid, people who met in the Centoria and Academy, integrity knights and warriors... Cardinal and possibly Administrator ... ... And maybe us_ (me?)_.  
Your love is big, wide and deep. It is enough to carry everything in the world.  
But that enemy is different.  
That man is the one who does not know the person's heart. Can not understand. So it asks. I will try to rob. It tries to break. That means ... ..._

I am afraid.

***

Gabrielle Miller saw a thin tear strip traveling to the boy's head. The hands holding the sword got shrunk in front of my chest as if it were frightening.

Finally, did you fear?

The fear and despair of those who died were the feelings of others who Gabriel could only sympathize with.

Gabriel caught a lot of human beings in search of sense of the soul from that day when he killed Alicia Klingerman at a young age in the forest behind his home. But never again did I see something like a cloud of light that came out of the forehead of Alicia. Instead, he felt hesitation by tasting fear.

What kind of taste is the fear that a boy who has been so confident enough to deceive it is dead?

Gabriel lifted the fingertip of the left hand high while feeling a hunger rising from the bottom of the body and licking his lips with a tongue tip.

Several small black spheres appeared, and buzzed like a fly.

When I lowered my fingers, an extremely fine laser struck from the black ball and stuck in and around the boy 's body. Blood leaves for a while and drifts like fog.

"Ha ha ha ha ha !!"

Gabriel who caught himself quickly while smiling, pulled out the empty sword.

Carelessly, I pierced the boy's belly.

The black shirt and the body covered with the coat were torn apart by the raging and empty, which was unintentionally disintegrated. Scattered blood and meat. Bone. An organ.

Gabriel pushed his left hand into the glow that is beautiful like a red ball.

Hanging from the upper body of the boy, still pulsing biggest jewel - dig the heart and cut it a thousand.

In the palm, as if to resist, the dragon which continues trembling is gently stuck to the mouth, and Gabriel whispered toward the dying boy drifting in the air with an empty expression.

***

"All of your emotions, memories, hearts and souls ... ... now I will eat you."

I was watching from the bottom of the eyelid closing the half-eye, as I said, the figure of an angel of death to say.

Gabrielle Miller opened a large undid lips and set up a sharp pointed tooth on the heart that I robbed from me, as if I were holding a ripe apple.

Zaritsu.

A terrible sound sounded like a scary sound.

The white surface is greatly distorted, and a lot of blood that is not mine is overflowing from that mouth.

Of course.

Because I ate a myriad of small blades that I had made from steel in my heart.

"Huh ... ...."

Randomly, I pressed back and retreated to Gabriel, I said with a broken voice.

"Is there such a thing ... that there is a heart and a memory, a body ...... just a vessel, memories are ... ... forever ..."

It is here.

It melts with the consciousness of me, it is united, and it can not be separated forever.

The pain that was by the torn down heart was such a terrible thing as to no longer be called pain. But this moment is the greatest last aircraft. There is no second time if you miss it.

Yujio has fought even after being divided.

I spread the swords of both hands to the left and right and exclaimed with flying blood splashing.

"Release • Recollection !!"

Pure white and jet black burst at the same time.

From the sword of the blue rose aiming at the front, several lines of ice vines are released, and the body of Gabriel is tied up in double and double.

And from the sword of the night sky that he raised just above.

A huge dark colored pillar stood up to the heavens.

The jet black light that stretched up with roaring sound penetrated the sky of blood color and reached far reaching height - as if it had crashed into the sun itself, it spread to all directions.

The sky is being covered.

Blood red is filled with tremendous speed, daytime light goes out.

The darkness quickly reaches the horizon and continues to spread further.

No, it is not an empty darkness. With a smooth texture and a slight temperature,

Infinite night sky.

***

An uninhabited wilderness, Shinon lying alone at the root of the forested rock formations, waiting quietly for the moment when the HP runs out.

Scratches on both legs blown off are constantly puffed, and mental consciousness is halved. I will continue to clench the tip of the chain that remain in the chest as strongly as to sit on a lifeline, but gradually the power does not enter the right hand as well.

At that time, it seemed that fading thought was foretelling logging out, or it got to real fainting.

The color of the sky has changed.

Although the sky was midday, the sky that was stained with the eerie blood color was covered with jet black at a terrible speed from the South. The light of the sun was shut off, the gray clouds were extinguished - and the darkness filled wrapped Shinon. Wrong. It is not perfect darkness.

The gentle phosphorescence that pours down from somewhere, lightly rocked overhead rocky mountains, dead trees, and neck chain. A refreshing breeze blown across and shook the bangs.

It's night. Narrative of the night which wraps the world gently, warmly and gently, healing.

Unexpectedly, Shinon remembered a distant past scene.

Overnight in the desert of a different world different from here. Shinon threw out and bashfully threw out, bashing, and crying, suffering from the memory of the incident encountered when he was young. The strength and gentleness of the arm holding the back and holding back at that time is full also in the overnight night sky.

_Well, this night is the heart of Kirito._

That man is by no means a dazzling sun. You stand at the top of people and never shine gently.

But, when you are in difficult times, when you are in difficult times somehow you will support me at the back. Heals sorrow and dries tears. Modestly, but like a sparkling star. Like the night.

Right now, Kirito will be in a decisive battle with Emperor Vector / Saturather to protect the world, people living here. I wish to pile it on an enormy that is too big, keep piling, and I'm wielding the last power.

Then, please - deliver, my heart also.

Shinon looked up at the night sky with pride in his eyes wet with tears hard.

A straight blue sky appeared on the head straight ahead.

***

Leafa laid down surrounded by countless orks and fist fighters, waiting for the last time as well.

There is no power to step on the right foot to exercise the resilience of Terraria anymore. The whole body that has been chopped up and penetrated is cold like freezing, and even his fingertips can not move.

"Leafa ... Do not die! It does not seem like dead!!"

Orc chieftain Rirupirin kneeling beside her, shouting to cry. Leafa smiled thinly and whispered the transparent tears that gathered to the limit in a small eye.

"Do not cry ... I will surely come back ... again."

Leafa thought that Rirupirin heard it, rolling his body and trembling his shoulders.

_I could not help the older brother directly, but it was okay with this. I played the role properly, did not I? That's right ......?_

And that moment. As if to respond to the voice of the heart of Leafa.

The color of the sky disappeared.

A surprise voice to the fact that the red daylight sky of the dark territory suddenly changed to the dark night was filled among orks and fist fighters. Rirupirin also raised its wet face and opened both eyes.

However, Leafa did not surprise or fear. It blown from the south so as to follow the darkness, and felt the older brother's smell in the night breeze gently stroking the stone.

"Onii-chan ... ..."

Murmuring, inhale a lot of air.

For Leafa / Suguha, Kirito was the nearest and the most distant existence at any time.

My brother probably thinks that he felt unconsciously before he saw the truth by himself. My parents now are not my true parents. By the time Suguha learned, Kirito had already put the shadows of isolation and isolation together. I never tried to deeply connect with anyone and kept breaking on my own from the edge where friendship was born.

That idiot makes his brother indulge in the net game, and the fact that the indulgence gave his brother "the brave who should release SAO" gave the role, but I do not believe that Suguha is coincidental irony. I do not think that it is a scheduled relief at the same time.

That is the way my older brother picked themselves. I will never escape, I will try to keep going on my back. That is the strength of the human being Kirito.

This night sky is nothing but a testimony that Kirito decided to carry this world all over the people who live there. Because ——

"...... Onii-chan is much more a swordsman more than I am."

Leafa swept the last force, moved both arms with no sense, and assembled to hold the bamboo sword on the chest.

And it took a while. To my brother 's sword, my heart' s power, delivery.

On the far side of the head, I saw a green star shining brightly.
