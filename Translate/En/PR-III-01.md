# Prologue III 

Star world calendar year 582

"Blue Rose 73. Confirm withdrawal of the airspace and shift to the interstellar cruising speed"

The integrity mechanic Suteica Shtolienen removed the mouth from a voice transmitter, and pushed the control rod forward with the left hand.

The bulk of the silver dragon vibrates. Both wings opened to the full, shine bright blue. It collects sparse resources of outer space from a wide range and sends it to the driving agency.

Immediately, the permanent heat sealed in the heart of the engine raises a shrill roar and reacts, and a white flame is spit out from the main injection hole on both sides of the long tail. Gun, the feeling that the body is pressed against the cockpit. A smile unexpectedly emerges in intense acceleration which can not be tasted within the planet's atmosphere.

『Blue Rose 74, consent』

There was a short response from the voice. Looking at the sub-picture board on the right side of the glance, the second aircraft follows obliquely behind while glowing the sparkle glow.

It was her partner ordained at the same time as Suteica, operating the second aircraft, Lauranei Arabel, also integrity mechanic. Despite being childish usual, but she gets even more irresponsible while maneuvering a machine dragon.

Especially, speed addiction is more than Suteica’s. Laughing lightly with a bitter smile.

"It's too fast, Laura"

『It’s just you are slow, Sutey』

_What only do you think?_

The discipline of the underworld space army is absolute, but the eyes of a demon instructor also does not reach outside the atmosphere. Besides, it is a long journey of three hours to the destination, satellite star Admina. Somewhat error comes out naturally.

Suteica pushed the control pole slightly more and pulled up to the second aircraft that was now lined up side by side, she laughed and deposited her body in the backrest.

Looking upward, the sight line captures an elaborate relief fitted in the canopy of a narrow cockpit.

A sword of black and white, aligned vertically. Surrounding it, flowers of blue roses and yellow-brawn olive. It is the emblem of "Star King" now becoming a legend.

Thirty years have already passed, after the King and the Queen have left the royal palace Central Cathedral on the main star Cardina (//yes, it’s definitely “star” though they mean “planet” – and use term planet further/).

Suteica only fourteen years old and Lauranei still only 15 years old, have never been directly audited. Both of them, however, were brought up with plenty of funny stories from their mothers who were also warriors. And the mothers also conveyed many old stories from their mothers as well.

The Shtolienen family and the Arabel family have been serving to the Star King as Konoe mechanics —  It seems that at that time it was called "knight" — during all the period of his reign that spanned two hundred years from the very beginning. (//Complex wordplay here and above. Old and new names both read “kishi”: knight (騎士) and “machine samurai” – mechanic (機士). Based on this, above there is a form “integrity mechanic” (整合機士) pronounced very similar to “integrity knight” (整合騎士). Finally the last form used is “Konoe mechanic” (近衛機士), where Konoe (近衛) is the name of special guards serving, protecting and reporting solely to Emperor in Japan - https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/近衛兵, i.e. Kirito’s personal battle mechanics squad. Riding mech dragons. /)

The ancestor before the seventh generation, the knights Teise Shtolienen and Ronnie Arabel protected the Star King before the throne and raised martial arts in the fight against the four emperors who had already exercised power on the Cardina’s 1st continent. The emperors and great aristocrats who had kept the expertise were abolished their power, and all the people who were oppressed in my territory were released.

The king then developed the first machine dragon, surpassing the continent, and exceeding the "end wall of the world" which had risen to the full of the atmosphere.

People patiently negotiate with the ancient God Beasts who had been in the undeveloped land, sometimes winning a one-on-one battle, pioneering fertile settlements one after another, and each tribe got it’s own country to maintain, even goblins and orks, which at that time were called "sub-people" and discriminated.

The eyes of the king who overcame the entireety of the star of Cardina eventually head towards the infinite universe.

Finally, we made the improvement and carried out the departure from the atmosphere.

Found a planet that is a satellite to Cardina and orbits Solus, named Admina.

After opening up a regular route by the dragon for navigation of large stars, after building the first immigrant city in the Admina star, he was supposed to be the first star of the underworld first.

Everyone believed that the prosperity of the two stars will last forever — under the rule of the king and the queen who had eternal forever and did not grow old, but those two issued a single prophecy and went down from the throne entering a long sleep. And thirty years ago, they did not appear again before the people at last, and they passed away.

Ever since, politics has been held by a parliament consisting of representatives of military and citizens. Currently there are no enemies to fight, the scale of the ground forces and the space army are being reduced, but according to the prophecy of the king, only the training of the aircraft kept the same harshness as in the old days.

The king said this.

_— Anyway, the gate of the different world "Real World" opens again.  
— At that time, huge change will be brought to the two worlds._

Although it is a story that Suteica can not actually feel about, it is said that an era will come when the surroundings of the underworld itself are uncertain after the gate of another world has opened. In addition to hoping for reconciliation and fraternity, if we not continue to refine our pride and power to penetrate our independence, humans, giants, goblins, orks and ogre human beings — the entire human family — will be hit by a tragedy that exceeds the "great world war" two hundred years ago.

But Suteica is not afraid.

_Whatever world you go to, what era will come, let me fight wonderfully if there are wings of machine dragons.  
Because I am a member of a glorious machine integrity squad with a tradition that goes continue from the era of Genesis far away._

Thinking so in the inner heart, she looked up again at the crest of the canopy —

It was just after that.

The front, the lower part of the main video board glows red and told that it sensed a predisposing aggregate of abnormal scale with both letters and warning sounds.

"What ...!?"

When screaming and jumping up, at the same time the tensioned voice of Lorraine echoed from the trance.

『Blue Rose 74, Detecting Approach of Dark-Organic Extra-Large Organisms! Factor density ... ... 7 billion!?』

"Myth grade space beast ... ...’Horror of the Abyss’... ...."

When saying the creature's name in the sacred words, the emptiness of the jet black which had already dropped the ink was already displayed at the right end of the Sea of Stars spreading in the main image board.

The creature given the unique name of Abyssal Horror (//here and further – in transliterated English/) was one of the worst of the confirmed space beasts. The total of 12 tall arms extended from a spherical body exceeding a maximum of 200 Mel. It is the size which reaches twenty times as much as the machine dragon.

And its huge body is composed only of dense darkness, it does not accept most attribute attacks. But the reason is called the worst was elsewhere.

Unlike many other divine beasts, Abyssal Horror does not accept any communication with humans. As if composed only of destruction and wish of slaughter, if it finds a dragon that navigates among stars, it attacks in a straight line and exhausts it.

In the past, it seems that the King, who was constantly in contact with God Beasts with respect, also suffered a tragedy that destroyed a large private aircraft dragon heading for the Admina star, and this cosmic beast was extinguished. However, the King who was even told that even one army could not completely annihilate Abyssal Horror.

Subsequent observations show that the cosmic animal keeps a constant speed and orbit around the two planets and as a measure of hardship all the machine dragons can avoid contact. It was decided to be permitted the interstellar navigation.

Of course, Suteica and Lauranei have taken off the Cardina star, picking the date and time that the space beast is flying far behind the Admina stars.

— Nevertheless.

"Why ... ... it is too early to appear ..."

Suteica got dizzy with the trembling hands on the control stick.

However, she immediately rebuilds her mind and shouts at the communication device with a sharp voice.

"Left turn 180 degrees, after withdrawal at full speed! We will retreat to Cardina airspace!"

『Roger that!!』

The voice of Lauranei who responds also has a tight resonance.

Suteica pulls the control rod daringly while turning the dragon to the left. The white flame gathers long from the attitude control injection hole, and the body is pressed against the seat with such a weight that it can not breath. The stars of the video board draw an arc and flow to the lower right.

When the turn was over, the main image board was full of the blue shine of the planet Cardina just taking off just a few dozen minutes ago. It seems that it will arrive if you reach out, it is actually far from hopeless.

Maximum acceleration is applied with praying feeling. A permanent hot flow shoots a scream and releases a roar.

However, the needle of the speedometer stops at the front of the threshold value of the limit value. Because Abyssal • Horror deprives resources from an extremely wide range, resource donor wing resource collectors can not demonstrate their original performance.

In the rear vision of the sub-picture board, the appearance of the space beast stained with jet black is obviously getting bigger by the time. Already, you can see clearly the tentacle arm that wriggles.

Among them, especially the tips of two long arms started to store vaguely violet light.

『Sutey, he's set to attack!』

Respond instantly to the voice from the second aircraft.

"See also here! Deploy a light barrier in the back!"

Saying, tap one of the buttons on the control panel with your left hand. The lumbar armor of the machine dragon opens with the sound of dinner. Breathe suddenly and concentrate consciousness.

"System • Call! Generate • Luminous • Element !!"

When screaming, ten photons were released from the hips of the dragon into the universe through the transmission path inside the control lever clenching.

Instantly they deform according to Suteica’s thoughts and make circular barrier.

Immediately after.

The space arm's tentacles launched a dazzling blue-violet light ball as if thrown.

Along with resonance sounds where metal is torn, dark attack bullets penetrate the universe.

In only 3 seconds, it touches the light barrier.

"... .... ah!"

Suteica screamed unexpectedly to the tremendous tremor that hit the dragon. At the same time, she heard a cry of Laurent Ney from the translation.

The two attack bullets easily shredded the barrier created by Suteica like a piece of paper and gleamed the back armor of the aircraft deeply.

Various instruments dye in red in an instant. An abnormality also occurs in the resource transmission path, and acceleration is dramatically slowed.

Suteica certainly felt that Abyssal Horror, which is only an amorphous darkness, caught grime through the sub-picture board.

Looking at the side image, the second aircraft is destroyed one wing and it is slowing down speed much.

"Laura! Laura!!"

Fortunately, when she called out to shout, there was a response with a hoarse voice.

『...... hey there, I am safe. But ... this girl can not fly anymore ......』

"... There is no choice but to escape outside the machine, only with the injector of the machine clothes, until Cardina ..."

『Impossible ...... No, I do not like that! I can not abandon this child !!』

Lauranei screaming.

Suteica could not say anything.

For a fighter, the dragon is not just a steel craft. It is the only buddy who made the heart through. Just like the flying dragon that the matching knights of old times were driving.

"... ... Yes, that's right."

Mumbling, Suteica gently enveloped the control stick with both hands.

Breathe in heavily, dazzle with a smile.

"Then, let's fight together till the end ... ... Re-turn, afterwards full attack with the main gun, that's fine, Laura"

『……Roger that』

The finishing communication, as usual, was only a single blunt word.

With a smile, Suteica slowly pulled the control stick and caused the damaged beloved dragon to turn again by one hundred and eighty degrees once again. A huge cosmic beast approaching is fully displayed on the main image board. There are eight attack munitions already stored in the enormous tentacles wandering around.

Oh...ooooooooo.......

Abyssal • Horror roared. Or maybe it laughed.

_At least, I will be rewarded for death. A little longer will pass before it will hit this route next time._

Prepared, Suteica pushed the red button on the control lever halfway.

The main gun equipped on the tip of the machine dragon opened a chisel. Originally, it generates the predisposition of the most effective attribute here, but against thin substance of Abyssal • Horror, even shots of anti-attribute can not deal any serious damage.

If so, casting the maneuvering sacred art, she was thinking that freezing attack would do best.

The dragon's beak shines clear blue.

When she glanced next to her, red light is leaking from the main gun of the second aircraft. It seems that Lauranei has chosen a thermal attack.

The cosmic animal approaching already in just a thousand mels, spread eight tentacles ready for attack.

Suteica breathed in a lot and tried to shout a shooting command.

However——.

『Wait ... ... Wait, Sutey! That is ... ...!』

Lauranei's startled voice passed through the right ear.

She thought, _what ever ... does she_, —— that moment.

Suteica also saw it.

A star comes down.

From the straight up direction of the main image board, one light that shines white comes close at a tremendous speed. She thought for a moment, if it could be a machine dragon!? But immediately deny. By the size, it is too small. Under 2 mel, only the size of a human being ......

Well.

That's right.

What looked like a star was the brightness of the light protective barrier in a spherical shape. Inside it is clearly visible the black shadow with the shape of a person.

The shining stopped about two hundred mels ahead of the two machine dragons.

It was almost simultaneous that Abyssal • Horror released eight light bullets with a huge roar. Before even get surprised with meeting a fresh-and-blood living human being in cryogenic outer space, Suteica cried.

"What are you doing! Run away quickly!"

But the unknown wouldn’t move.

While swinging the hem of a long coat, he stood still at one point in the space with his arms folded.

Such thin protective walls, against the attack ball of Abyssal • Horror is not as good as thin paper. Suteica visually imagined that as soon as one of the attack bullets that roared and pulsed, touched human, blood be splat and meat get dispersed.

"Run away !!"

『Flee it!!』

Simultaneously with her, Lauranei screamed as well.

Eight blue violet light bullets, one of which seems to be about 3 mel in diameter, fly along with a metal roaring. It stopped at void as if it crashed into an invisible wall, and all bounced back in random directions. The universe trembled.

A myriad of stars reflected on both eyes of Suteica spread apart and made a ripple like the surface of the water and shook. Immediately afterwards, the shock-waves that arrived shook the bulk of the dragon. 

Suteica who lost the word realized that a small instrument on the right end of the device board was able to jump to the top end in an instant.

"Lie ... .... Ca ... ... It can’t be..."

Suteica never saw that instruments called "psychometer", even about 20% of it’s max. 

In the ear, Lauranei's fearful voice echoes.

『...... I can not believe it ...... Such a strength feeling... .... It’s like the entire universe is shaking...』

But there is no doubt about the facts before you.

Only the fact that a small living human being reflected the cosmic beast's attack without using a predisposing barrier only with his incarnation — the secret mystery technique of the ancient knights.

Oh ... ... Oooo ooooooooooo—— ... ....

In the distance, Abyssal • Horror shrugs.

_Is it anger or frightening?  
Did it realize that remote attacks by dark bullets did not work?_ 

The cosmic beast started rushing while throwing countless tentacles forward.

The confronting small figure turned the two arms that were spread out to the back, and produced two long swords equipped there.

"No way ... ... Is he about to fight with a sword!?"

She lent forward and poked her hands on the image board.

The full length of Abyssal • Horror exceeds 200 mel. Moreover, the body is a collection of entities without substance.

It is not an opponent who can manage with a metal blade with a length less than 1 Mel.

However, the mysterious swordsmen pointed white sword in the left hand with no further action exactly to the big beast.

He shouted.

Even through the empty outer space and the thick armor of the dragon, the voice of the swordsman sounded elegantly in the ears of Suteica.

『_Release • Recollection!!_』

An intense white light burned the main image board.

At the center of the image that recovered soon, it was seen from the swordsman's blade that some pale ray of light rushed into the Abyssal • Horror.

Though compared with the massive of the cosmic beast, it was thin like a thread, the rushing speed of the entwined beast pierced by it is slowed down and weakened. Twelve tentacles freely wandering also rapidly rigidify. Just as if it froze.

_However, such a thing is impossible. Abyssal • Horror is a creature adapted to the space which is a cryogenic environment. Such as cold air which is even lower than the temperature of outer space can not be produced._

A whispering voice of Lauranei echoed from the ear blew away the stunk of Suteica.

『That is ... ... That technique is nothing else than "Complete Armament Control"... .... No, even "Memory Liberation Technique"... ...?』

"Err ... ... such a thing, it should be used only for the top ranking machine!"

『But ... that move, that's definitely...』

An outrageous roar of a cosmic beast that echoed three times broke out of a cut call.

Oots ...... Oooooonnnnnnn!!

Suddenly the caught body trembled and three new tentacles emerged. They become jet black spears and attack the mysterious swordsman.

However, the swordsman in a calm but dazzling movement, swung another sword, this time in the right hand.

And shouted again.

『_Release • Recollection!!_』

It was deeper, heavier, more dense darkness than the cosmic tentacles.

The tremendously huge dark blade perhaps exceeding 50 mel in length hit three tentacles.

At the moment both sides contacted, shock waves were generated that seemed to cause the space to distort again, and shaken the machine dragon. The blue-violet electric light crawls through the void, letting the image board dazzle.

Already, Suteica could not speak because of surprise.

_To activate secret mystery technique which should be used only for the seven highest-ranking matching machines twice at the same time? To take Abyssal • Horror's full power attack, to which Destroyer Dragon's crew can not compete against, by just one person?  
I can not believe that such swordsmen exist, even among Centoria's founders._

But——.

The truly amazing sight was waiting ahead.

『Sutey!! One... ... One more person, a swordswoman!』

When she hurriedly adverted the gaze, she saw a new human figure coming down from the same direction as the mysterious two-sword fighter appeared.

That one is even more petite. You can see the long hair and skirt swaying through the light barrier. To the right, rarely delicate rapier.

The female swordsman keeps the right hand all the way.

She swung downward with supple movement.

Suteica saw rainbow-colored aura appear in straight line in the jet-black universe and beat up beautifully. At the same time, it sounded like a mysterious choir of countless singers singing.

La——.

The needle of psychometric gauge was shivering at the upper end.

The stars.

Large number of huge meteorites wrapped with flame emerges from nowhere, crossing overhead.

Asteroids on the route connecting Cardina and Admina must have been destroyed no less than a decade ago.

However, the impossible weight feeling enough to destroy the entire dragon is within her vision.

Noticing the huge rocks rushing towards it, Abyssal Horror tried to catch it.

Newly created two tentacles and sprinkle as if they were to catch a star.

The collision was silent.

The tip of the burning meteorite instantly desolates the arms of the cosmic beast.

Easy subduction in the center of the giant.

It crushed the dark agglutinating beast with a blow.

Oooooooo-o-o-o-o-o——.............

The sharp screams of the supernatural creature overlapped with the explosive sound of the meteorite and resonated into the universe. The great release of resources from pure white through crimson to purple burned hard the eye of Suteica.

"... ... ... you defeated ... ... ... ... that monster ... ...?"

She whispered in low voice.

But——.

『Ah ... ... still not ... ... yet!』

A second pilot, who was just a little closer than Suteica, was quick to notice the phenomenon. The fragments of Abyssal • Horror, which she thought were all burned up by explosion, scattered in pieces, came together unexpectedly.

The chunk of darkness, just several tens of cens, which is too miniscule compared with the original bulky substance, escapes while irregularly rubbing like a flock of flies.

According to the records, Star King once also beat the beast so far.

However, it could not eliminate Abyssal • Horror entirely, it escaped as thousands of fragments. The beast which fled to the end of the universe eventually healed the wound and began to hit the route again.

With this, the legend is only repeated.

"No, don’t let it escape! Really destroy them all this time!!"

Unexpectedly, Suteica cried.

However, two swords swordsman and rapier wearer seem to be unable to move at once. It is unclear, maybe it exerted a huge blow to conscience.

The fragments of Abyssal • Horror draw a weird trajectory and flew away.

——When.

A flock of flies was suddenly disarrayed.

It gets scattered and shows irregular movements as if running away.

Suteica took a breath and expanded a viewport by touching the main image board with her fingertips.

She saw the golden light.

It further extended into something that emits pure shine like a small Solus.

"……Human……"

There was a third swordsman.

Hair as if gold was springing. Armor also of gold. Pure white skirt. The eyes that watch the enemy unwavering is the sky blue.

_...... I know._

"I ... ... this swordsman ...... No, a knight, I know her."

Suteica whispered. Instantly, 『Me too』 is returned with Lauranei's voice.

This golden knight was the figure drawn in a huge decorated portrait between the thrones on the fiftieth floor of the Central Cathedral. One of the strongest integrity knights in history, which is said to have disappeared in the middle of battle, raising a number of deeds in an ancient war of different worlds. Certainly, her name is ——.

"... Alice ......-sama ...?"

The knight's right hand moved as if she could hear the voice.

The long sword of the left hip, unsheathed in a smooth gesture.

The blade of bright yellow tinge reflected the light of Solus and got even more terrible brilliance. The fragments of the cosmic beast lose control as if fearful, fleeing and running away.

The knight holds a long sword in both hands in front of the body.

She shouted out with a voice reminiscent of the wind blowing into space. The needle of the psychometer broke out with a small explosion sound.

『_Release • Recollection!!_』

A sword extinguishes a strong flash.

The blade is dissolved! Along with the metal sound, it breaks into countless strips.

The knight moved the handle which remained on the right hand slowly.

The strips spread like a petal, like a petal dancing in the wind, ... ... and void.

It turned into a golden meteor shower and flew at a stretch.

Each one of the small lights penetrates fragments of the escaping cosmic beast with a terrifying precision. The shadow of the shadow of darkness is burned down to golden glow and evaporates.

"............ wow ... ..."

Suteica could only mumble.

Even if you arrange all the dragons of the integrity machinery team and fire all the main guns at a time, this precision and power can not be hoped for.

When the last one of the fragments of Abyssal • Horror, which was the worst fearful Underworld universe beast, was pierced by a golden arrow, an extraordinary scream came unprecedented.

Giiii-ii-i-i-i-i-o-o-o-o-o-o………….

Finally, the cosmic beast has completely disappeared.

Suteica just stunnedly watched the golden meteors gather at the hands of the knight and went back to a single long sword again.

Even if the golden knight is integrity knight Alice of old times, who are the remaining two?

In the video board, the golden knight who paid the sword in the sheath flies through the air and approaches the black sword fighter and the pearl swordsman.

After having briefly exchanged something, three people turned around to watchers together. Their faces cannot be seen. But it’s clear that the three of them have a smile on their mouths.

Two-sword swordsman returned white and black long sword back and shook his right hand lightly.

That moment——.

A huge deep, very deep emotion unknown to her was passed through the inside of Suteica's back.

Hard to breath, enough to be painful.

"Ah ... ... ah ......"

It overlapped with the leaked sigh, and the voice of Lauranei sounded quietly in the ears.

"Sutey. I know. I know that people."

"Yeah, Laura ... I, too, I do."

She nods twice, three times.

It is not stored as knowledge like a portrait between thrones. Not so.

My heart. My fingertips. My soul. They remember.

Unexpectedly, the smell of sweet and savory honey pie tickles her nose.

The refreshing wind blowing across the meadow. The warmth of the sun which calms down.

Distant, slightly echoing laughter.

Suteica was casually putting on an airtight helmet and pulled the handle on the right side of the cockpit.

First, the insulation lets the air to come out. An armor board that protects the dragon's cockpit seats unfolds and the star ocean spreads above the head. The second aircraft also opens the boarding pass in the same way.

Suteica stand up and in about 30 mel from the cockpit saw the three swordsmen who kept their hands waving with her own eyes.

Impossible.

One more person —.

The eyes of autumn leaves of Suteica certainly caught the appearance of the fourth swordsman that appeared to be shaking. A young man standing right after the two-blade swordsman in the black clothing and smiling gently. Its appearance is shiny and it seems to disappear the moment you take your eyes off, swaying like a sunrise.

The young man with flax hair slowly nodded greatly towards Suteica.

Tears flowed from both eyes of Suteica.

Warm drops go down the face and is stopped by the airtight helmet.

Eventually the figure of a young man died away as if melted in the light of Solus which appeared from the shade of Cardina.

At the same time, the young integrity mechanic understood the truth.

This — this very moment is the beginning of a new era as written in the prophecy of the Star King.

They are messengers who emerge from the past and open the doors of the future.

From this time, the world begins to change.

A door of another world opens, the tide of a new era loudly rushes up.

It doesn’t mean the coming of paradise. It is likely that a revolutionary change and a turbulent era that can not be imagined come to the Underworld.

However, there was no fear in Suteica.

Because —.

Because my heart hurts so much.

Because the trembling soul was longing for this encounter.

When she shake down tears with blinking, Suteica looked straight ahead.

While standing up, with her fingertips gently pushed the control stick forward.

The wounded dragon's wings born a faint blue shine.

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0425.jpg)

Permanent heat element breathes, and a small thrust moves the spacecraft.

She glanced to the Lauranei nearby for a moment and got deep nod in response.

A girl born within the Underworld, the integrity mechanic Suteica Shtolienen moved the dragon slowly.

To the swordsmen who waved their hands to her, to strangers, to knights of the past.

To the door of the next era.

To the future.
