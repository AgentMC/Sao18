# Prologue III 

Star world calendar year 582

"Blue Rose 73. Confirm withdrawal of the airspace and shift to the interstellar cruising speed"

The integrity mechanic Suteica Shtolienen removed the mouth from a voice transmitter, and pushed the control rod forward with the left hand.

The bulk of the silver dragon vibrates. Both wings opened to the full, shine bright blue. It collects sparse resources of outer space from a wide range and sends it to the driving agency.

Immediately, the permanent heat sealed in the heart of the engine raises a shrill roar and reacts, and a white flame is spit out from the main injection hole on both sides of the long tail. Gun, the feeling that the body is pressed against the cockpit. A smile unexpectedly emerges in intense acceleration which can not be tasted within the planet's atmosphere.

『Blue Rose 74, consent』

There was a short response from the voice. Looking at the sub-picture board on the right side of the glance, the second aircraft follows obliquely behind while glowing the sparkle glow.

It was her partner ordained at the same time as Suteica, operating the second aircraft, Lauranei Arabel, also integrity mechanic. Despite being childish usual, but she gets even more irresponsible while maneuvering a machine dragon.

Especially, speed addiction is more than Suteica’s. Laughing lightly with a bitter smile.

"It's too fast, Laura"

『It’s just you are slow, Sutey』

_What only do you think?_

The discipline of the underworld space army is absolute, but the eyes of a demon instructor also does not reach outside the atmosphere. Besides, it is a long journey of three hours to the destination, satellite star Admina. Somewhat error comes out naturally.

Suteica pushed the control pole slightly more and pulled up to the second aircraft that was now lined up side by side, she laughed and deposited her body in the backrest.

Looking upward, the sight line captures an elaborate relief fitted in the canopy of a narrow cockpit.

A sword of black and white, aligned vertically. Surrounding it, flowers of blue roses and yellow-brawn osmanthus. It is the emblem of "Star King" now becoming a legend.

Thirty years have already passed, after the King and the Queen have left the royal palace Central Cathedral on the main star Cardinal (//yes, it’s definitely “star” though they mean “planet” – and use term planet further/).

Suteica only fourteen years old and Lauranei still only 15 years old, have never been directly audited. Both of them, however, were brought up with plenty of funny stories from their mothers who were also warriors. And the mothers also conveyed many old stories from their mothers as well.

The Shtolienen family and the Arabel family have been serving to the Star King as Konoe mechanics —  It seems that at that time it was called "knight" — during all the period of his reign that spanned two hundred years from the very beginning. (//Complex wordplay here and above. Old and new names both read “kishi”: knight (騎士) and “machine samurai” – mechanic (機士). Based on this, above there is a form “integrity mechanic” (整合機士) pronounced very similar to “integrity knight” (整合騎士). Finally the last form used is “Konoe mechanic” (近衛機士), where Konoe (近衛) is the name of special guards serving, protecting and reporting solely to Emperor in Japan - https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/近衛兵, i.e. Kirito’s personal battle mechanics squad. Riding mech dragons. /)

The ancestor before the seventh generation, the knights Teise Shtolienen and Ronnie Arabel protected the Star King before the throne and raised martial arts in the fight against the four emperors who had already exercised power on the Cardinal’s 1st continent. The emperors and great aristocrats who had kept the expertise were abolished their power, and all the people who were oppressed in my territory were released.

The king then developed the first machine dragon, surpassing the continent, and exceeding the "end wall of the world" which had risen to the full of the atmosphere.

People patiently negotiate with the ancient God Beasts who had been in the undeveloped land, sometimes winning a one-on-one battle, pioneering fertile settlements one after another, and each tribe got it’s own country to maintain, even goblins and orks, which at that time were called "sub-people" and discriminated.

The eyes of the king who overcame all the stars of Cardinal eventually head towards the infinite universe.

Finally, we made the improvement and carried out the departure from the atmosphere.

Found a planet that is a satellite to Cardinal and orbits Solus, named Admina.

After opening up a regular route by the dragon for navigation of large stars, after building the first immigrant city in the Admina star, he was supposed to be the first star of the underworld first.

Everyone believed that the prosperity of the two stars will last forever — under the rule of the king and the queen who had eternal forever and did not grow old, but those two issued a single prophecy and went down from the throne entering a long sleep. And thirty years ago, they did not appear again before the people at last, and they passed away.

Ever since, politics has been held by a parliament consisting of representatives of military and citizens. Currently there are no enemies to fight, the scale of the ground forces and the space army are being reduced, but according to the prophecy of the king, only the training of the aircraft kept the same harshness as in the old days.

The king said this.

_— Anyway, the gate of the different world "Real World" opens again.  
— At that time, huge change will be brought to the two worlds._

Although it is a story that Suteica can not actually feel about, it is said that an era will come when the surroundings of the underworld itself are uncertain after the gate of another world has opened. In addition to hoping for reconciliation and fraternity, if we not continue to refine our pride and power to penetrate our independence, humans, giants, goblins, orks and ogre human beings — the entire human family — will be hit by a tragedy that exceeds the "great world war" two hundred years ago.

But Suteica is not afraid.

_Whatever world you go to, what era will come, let me fight wonderfully if there are wings of machine dragons.  
Because I am a member of a glorious machine integrity squad with a tradition that goes continue from the era of Genesis far away._

Thinking so in the inner heart, she looked up again at the crest of the canopy —

It was just after that.

The front, the lower part of the main video board glows red and told that it sensed a predisposing aggregate of abnormal scale with both letters and warning sounds.

"What ...!?"

When screaming and jumping up, at the same time the tensioned voice of Lorraine echoed from the trance.

『Blue Rose 74, Detecting Approach of Dark-Organic Extra-Large Organisms! Factor density ... ... 7 billion!?』

"Myth grade space beast ... ...’Horror of the Abyss’... ...."

When saying the creature's name in the sacred words, the emptiness of the jet black which had already dropped the ink was already displayed at the right end of the Sea of Stars spreading in the main image board.

The creature given the unique name of Abyssal Horror (//here and further – in transliterated English/) was one of the worst of the confirmed space beasts. The total of 12 tall arms extended from a spherical body exceeding a maximum of 200 Mel. It is the size which reaches twenty times as much as the machine dragon.

And its huge body is composed only of dense darkness, it does not accept most attribute attacks. But the reason is called the worst was elsewhere.

Unlike many other divine beasts, Abyssal Horror does not accept any communication with humans. As if composed only of destruction and wish of slaughter, if it finds a dragon that navigates among stars, it attacks in a straight line and exhausts it.

In the past, it seems that the King, who was constantly in contact with God Beasts with respect, also suffered a tragedy that destroyed a large private aircraft dragon heading for the Admina star, and this cosmic beast was extinguished. However, the King who was even told that even one army could not completely annihilate Abyssal Horror.

Subsequent observations show that the cosmic animal keeps a constant speed and orbit around the two planets and as a measure of hardship all the machine dragons can avoid contact. It was decided to be permitted the interstellar navigation.

Of course, Suteica and Lauranei have taken off the Cardinal star, picking the date and time that the space beast is flying far behind the Admina stars.

— Nevertheless.

"Why ... ... it is too early to appear ..."

Suteica got dizzy with the trembling hands on the control stick.

However, she immediately rebuilds her mind and shouts at the communication device with a sharp voice.

"Left turn 180 degrees, after withdrawal at full speed! We will retreat to Cardinal airspace!"

『Roger that!!』

The voice of Lauranei who responds also has a tight resonance.

Suteica pulls the control rod daringly while turning the dragon to the left. The white flame gathers long from the attitude control injection hole, and the body is pressed against the seat with such a weight that it can not breath. The stars of the video board draw an arc and flow to the lower right.

When the turn was over, the main image board was full of the blue shine of the planet Cardinal just taking off just a few dozen minutes ago. It seems that it will arrive if you reach out, it is actually far from hopeless.

Maximum acceleration is applied with praying feeling. A permanent hot flow shoots a scream and releases a roar.

However, the needle of the speedometer stops at the front of the threshold value of the limit value. Because Abyssal • Horror deprives resources from an extremely wide range, resource donor wing resource collectors can not demonstrate their original performance.

In the rear vision of the sub-picture board, the appearance of the space beast stained with jet black is obviously getting bigger by the time. Already, you can see clearly the tentacle arm that wriggles.

Among them, especially the tips of two long arms started to store vaguely violet light.

『Sutey, he's set to attack!』

Respond instantly to the voice from the second aircraft.

"See also here! Deploy a light barrier in the back!"

Saying, tap one of the buttons on the control panel with your left hand. The lumbar armor of the machine dragon opens with the sound of dinner. Breathe suddenly and concentrate consciousness.

"System • Call! Generate • Luminous • Element !!"

When screaming, ten photons were released from the hips of the dragon into the universe through the transmission path inside the control lever clenching.

Instantly they deform according to Suteica’s thoughts and make circular barrier.

Immediately after.

The space arm's tentacles launched a dazzling blue-violet light ball as if thrown.

Along with resonance sounds where metal is torn, dark attack bullets penetrate the universe.

In only 3 seconds, it touches the light barrier.

"... .... ah!"

Suteica screamed unexpectedly to the tremendous tremor that hit the dragon. At the same time, she heard a cry of Laurent Ney from the translation.

The two attack bullets easily shredded the barrier created by Suteica like a piece of paper and gleamed the back armor of the aircraft deeply.

Various instruments dye in red in an instant. An abnormality also occurs in the resource transmission path, and acceleration is dramatically slowed.

Suteica certainly felt that Abyssal Horror, which is only an amorphous darkness, caught grime through the sub-picture board.

Looking at the side image, the second aircraft is destroyed one wing and it is slowing down speed much.

"Laura! Laura!!"

Fortunately, when she called out to shout, there was a response with a hoarse voice.

『...... hey there, I am safe. But ... this girl can not fly anymore ......』

"... There is no choice but to escape outside the machine, only with the injector of the machine clothes, until Cardinal ..."

『Impossible ...... No, I do not like that! I can not abandon this child !!』

Lauranei screaming.

Suteica could not say anything.

For a fighter, the dragon is not just a steel craft. It is the only buddy who made the heart through. Just like the flying dragon that the matching knights of old times were driving.

"... ... Yes, that's right."

Mumbling, Suteica gently enveloped the control stick with both hands.

Breathe in heavily, dazzle with a smile.

"Then, let's fight together till the end ... ... Re-turn, afterwards full attack with the main gun, that's fine, Laura"

『……roger that』
