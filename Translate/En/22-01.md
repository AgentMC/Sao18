# Chapter 22 “The Decisive Battle” 
## Part 1
7th July 2026 / Human Calendar November 8th, year 380th 

"Damn !!"

Critter, an information warfare member of the Ocean•Turtle Raid Team, briefly scoffed at the view of the large monitor on the front of the console.

the aggregation of red dots which has reached 30 thousand At the maximum, rapidly disappears from the center toward the outside.

In other words, the VRMMO players in China and Korea that were put into underworld by the secret of Vasago are annihilated by some means and are automatically logged out.

At the center of the red circle, the human soldier displayed in blue and the white Japanese troops together remain on the scale of one thousand people. It is too big to ignore and it is even more dangerous if it is said that 1,000 people have the power to destroy 30,000 Chinese-Korean coalition forces.

"... ... what is this vagabond doing ...?"

Critter gazed at a point on the monitor while tapping tightly.

There is only one strongly shining red dot in the immediate vicinity of the Japanese troops. From the next STL room, it is Vasago who converted his own account and in the Dive. Even though you are near the enemy, it does not seem like moving from battle.

_You can not move, with prisoners, or something? Or is there still a power behind to manage a thousand enemy forces by itself?_

Critter kept the urge to Rush into the STL room now and wake up Vasago and shake the nape collapsing.

Under the current situation that the administrator's privilege on the underworld has been locked up, it is not possible to reset the account. In other words, if you forcibly log out Vasago, the account he is using now will never be used again. What is possible is only the operation of the time acceleration factor which is an isolated function from the seed program, but it is also necessary to carefully timed to do it.

After making a deep breath, Critter lowered the magnification of the map on the monitor.

Another red dot which is moving at high speed still in the southern part of the underworld. Captain of the attack team, Gabriel Miller.

The thing to think about now is whether he has secured Alice or at last the chief Miller being tracked, the possibility that the human forces army will catch up.

As a result of sending large numbers of players from the United States, China and South Korea, the southward movement of the human forces army was greatly hindered. Now Captain Miller is hundreds of miles ahead of the inside distance. Although it is a distance that can fly to Jet fighter as far as it is, it is hard to think that there is such thing in underworld. At most, it will be about winged biological units.

_They will not catch up with you._

Critter judged on a long thought of about three seconds.

Look at the clock on the left wrist. Nine o'clock in the morning of the 7th of July.

It is eight hours and twenty minutes until the afternoon six o'clock when the command force of the SDF comes in from the escort ship. Instructions left by Miller resumed acceleration for the rest of the eight hours - that is, at 10 a.m., but the players who gathered from the outside almost completely wiped out Now, the meaning of maintaining equal magnitude Absent.

Then, at this moment, you should accelerate the underworld time again to 1000 times, and captain Miller should earn time to secure Alice.

"Geez ... Hey, Vasago, I will step on it for a while now"

When talking to the red dot of the main battlefield which has not yet moved in a minute, the critter stretched his right hand to the lever for manipulating the fluctlight acceleration magnification.

I looked up the magnification slider on the main monitor, which works in conjunction with the lever, and the line of sight stops on the horizontal scale gradually.

Now the needle of the slider is at the bottom, at x1. From there the scales are cut in increments of x100, with a red divider drawn at x1000.

In fact, the scale continues even further above it, and it is delimited again at x1200. Apparently there seems to be a safe line when a living human being dives using STL.

However, the magnification slider still grows upwards, eventually reaching x5000. If human beings are not dive - the only people in the world who are fluctlights, the internal time can be accelerated to that point.

The time acceleration magnification is determined by operating a physical lever on the console and pushing a button with an open / close cover next to it. While careful not to touch the button, the critter slowly pushes up the side-gripping lever like the throttle lever of a ship or airplane.

The slider on the monitor rises smoothly, and the digital numbers are swiftly switched next to each other.

At x1000, the sense of resistance felt hard.

When it was pushed strongly, the lever moved further and stopped again at x1200. From there, there is no sign of moving any more, no matter how much power you put in.

"Oh no ..."

Critter was inspired by curiosity and gazed at the metal large lever.

As soon as I realized that next to the decision button there was a silver shining keyhole.

"I see"

I laugh with a single finger scratching my shaved head

The fact that the internal time safety limit is one thousand two hundred times is that the actual dangerous area should be a little over. 

It is not unlikely to try to release the safety device in case it is tight to the last minute.

The Critter turned around for each of the chairs snapped a finger pointing towards the members who just returned to the control room.

"Is anyone a picking specialist?"

***

_How soft it is ... it smells good ... ...._

I definitely had the best sleep in the past few months. Higa Takeru therefore resisted the limits to someone's voice trying to wake up desperately with his ear.

"...... Uh, Higa! Wait a moment! Open your eyes, hey !!!"
