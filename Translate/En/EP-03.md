## Part 3

Higa Takeru looked at the press conference from RATH Roppongi branch, which is close to the hall.

The shoulder of the right hand shot at the Ocean • Turtle raid incident was severely cured and the cast was also taken away. However, scars penetrated by the pistol bullet still remain clearly. It seemed possible to erase it if you undergo plastic surgery, but Higa is going to leave it as it is.

TV switched from the live broadcast of the press conference to the studio, and the castor began to explain this "major incident".

『...... This organization of marine resources exploration research is that we were conducting research on autonomous submarine for deep sea exploration within self-propelled mega float "Ocean Turtle ", but recently a massive reported raid We are also talking about the relationship with the story.』

The commentator nods deeply and comments.

『Yes, in one theory, it is said that the purpose of the attack itself was to take this artificial intelligence. Although it is difficult to conclude in the current situation and even the identification of the criminal group is not done ...』

『There is also the question of why the SDF escort ship "Nagato" was berthing in the neighboring waters at that time, why did not you go to relief for twenty-four hours? Although the defense ministry responded to the National Assembly that the security of the hostage had the highest priority, however, in reality, the victims have been exposed to security personnel …』

The screen switches there, and a face picture of one man appears.

Black clothes, glasses hide facial expressions underneath the SDF's first type of ceremonial clothes hidden in the eye for a minute without any gaps.

Title appears next to the picture.

【Seiichiro Kikuoka-san who sacrificed himself in the raid incident. 】

Higa pushed the words with a long sigh.

"No way ... ... you who did not think she would become a victim of a lady, Kikuoka-san..."

Then, a person standing by the side shook his head.

"Oh yeah, really it was ... ...."

Cotton three-quarter length pants, sneakers came out and a bad taste pattern shirt. From the shorter head of the shaved head, a thin beard stinging from the ear to the chin is stored. On the face, mirror lens sunglasses.

A monster who took out a cheesy ramune candy container from his chest pocket and finally threw it into a single grain mouth kept smiling and finally continued.

"But this is the best hand, Higa-kun. Even though I kept being left untouched I could literally be erased when I got stuffed or I could literally disappear and it was only when there was a pressure that a dead man came out in the case of an attack, so I could drive the domestic disturbing forces over there. Well, it is surprising that the defense secretary of defense of that Teippen was a big deal.”

"It seems that a considerable amount of money has flowed from the American weapons maker to the vice-minister, but ... as it is ..."

Higa returned his eyes to the TV and asked while shrugging his shoulders.

"Really, do not you publicize this human fluctlight extensively like this? Well then, the plan to install the unmanned weapon, which is the final goal of RATH, is a completely undoable, Kiku-san."

"The good thing, in short, even you can tell it to the US side even that it is possible."

RATH commander who was able to escape injury to the organs and to recover sooner than Higa, while piercing through the flank with the ballistic bullet in bullets fired from the attacker's assault rifle • Seiki Kikuoka finally barely finished and laughed.

"With this weapons maker in the other side will not be able to manage such as pushing the technological release publicly on the vertical AI development. When the human fluctlight has already been perfectly completed, see this interview. Well, they will have no choice but to give up ... No, altogether ... Alice's beauty is more than human ...... "

Kikuoka looked up at the image of Alice once again displayed on the TV screen, and Kikuoka glanced at the thin eyed eyes of the sunglasses.

"That's right ...... exactly, the crystal spirit of the Alicization process ..."

For a while, even though closing all together, Higa thought in a corner of his head.

_Speaking of which — RATH was aiming to realize "high adaptive artificial intelligence", who gave the initial letters "ALICE". That girl was raised with the name of Alice even in Underworld Was it eventually just a miraculous coincidence?  
If not by chance, what reasons could exist there. Like Yanai, is it the result of someone interfering inside secretly by RATH staff? Or ... ... In addition to the staff, I logged on someone to Underworld......_

Higa stopped thinking, when turning around, I watched the two STLs lining the back of the large room.

He himself — Kazuto Kirigaya lies down on the same machine used for three consecutive days of continuous diving just a few months ago.

A catheter for infusion on the left arm. An electrode for electrocardiogram monitoring on the chest. The face whose eyelids were closed seems to have more meat falling during the coma of three weeks than since it was transported from Ocean • Turtle.

However, the sleeping face was calm. In the mouth, it seems that even satisfaction is drifting.

That was the same as one young girl sleeping immediately next to him — Yuki Asuna.

The fluctlight activity of the two people is continuously monitored by STL.

Not all reactions have disappeared from the brain. If the fluctlight is completely self-destructed, even breathing will stop. However, the spiritual activity has declined to the limit and the hope of recovery is no longer being declined.

That is also natural. Kirigaya and Asuna should have experienced a huge time of 200 years before the marginal acceleration phase is stopped. Its length can only be imagined for Higa who lives only twenty-six years. It is already a miracle that the heart is still moving after the years that exceeded the theoretical lifespan of fluctlight.

Explanation and apology for the two families were carried out by Higa and Dr. Koujiro as soon as they were transferred to Roppongi. They revealed almost all the truth, except that the entity of RATH is partly composed of a minister and a members of SDF and related workers.

The parents of Kirigaya Kazuto did not disturb the things and just showed tears. It may have been because the sister had already heard the rough circumstances. The problem was father of Yuki Asuna.

In any case, he is the former President and CEO of that gigantic enterprise. Angry is fiercely, but was the momentum just does murder the same day accused, was the mother had stopped it surprisingly.

Asuna’s mother who is a professor at the university, stroking the sleeping daughter's hair, said.

_— I believe in my daughter. My daughter never does something that will silence and disappear to us. She surely will come home cheerfully. So, I will wait a little more._

_At this time, the two parents will also be watching a press conference broadcast. The figure of new human beings that their children kept safely.  
Alice — It can not sacrifice this memorial day, when artificial fluctlight took the first step into the real world daringly.  
So, please wake up, Kirito-kun, Asuna-san._

Kikuoka suddenly pushed the arm of Higa with his elbow.

"Hey, Higa-kun"

"... .... what, Kiku-san. I am concentrating now."

"Higa-kun, if you see that ... ... look"

"If it is a press conference, let's finish already, the reporter's question is almost within the range of expectation ..."

Higa, who raised his face while mumbling, realized that the arm of Kikuoka holding the Ramune container points to the right sub monitor, not the relay screen.

The two windows displayed there are real time monitoring information of the two STLs.

A vaguely light white ring is floating on a black background. Its gloomy shimmer that does not move in a minute, the afterglow of the sleeping boy and girl ... ...

Pi-kin.

And a very small peak protruded from a part of the ring and soon faded away. Higa blinked under glasses violently and panted with a throat pinched.

***

The voices of Dr. Koujiro echoed in the vast press conference hall again.

『... ... It will take a long, long time. There is no need to rush to a conclusion. I would like you to interact, feel and think through the virtual world with people who are supposed to be born after a new process in the future. That is the only thing the organization wants this viewer to watch. 』

After finishing the speech, the doctor seated, but there was no applause.

On the reporters' face, still more embarrassment still floats.

Immediately, the next questioner raised his hand and stood up.

『Doctor, how do you think about the danger? In other words, it can be said that AIs absolutely have no way to extinct human beings and rule the earth? 』

As if killing by a look, Dr. Koujiro answers.

『Except for one case, it is impossible. It is only when we try to extinct them from us. 』

『But in many novels and movies from long ago ... 』

At the time the question was about to continue, Alice, who was seated, all of a sudden rose strongly. Pulls the body as if the questioner were pressured.

Alice opened her eyes wide and looked in the empty space as if he listened to the distant sounds, after a few seconds he said shortly.

『I urgently need to leave. I will excuse myself here. 』

She turns her long blonde and quickly disappears to the sleeve of the stage at the maximum speed at which the body of the machine can come out.

Reporters, as well as countless viewers in front of television, also lost their words quietly.

Urgently — said Alice, is there more important than this meeting?

Dr. Koujiro who was left alone on the stage looked like she was surprised, but eventually changed her expression as thought of something. There was no press who breathed heavily and noticed that a faint smile had gone past its exhilarating mouth.

***

It is not a mistake to see.
