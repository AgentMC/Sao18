"I’ll ... never... ...forgi......!!"

Ha-doom !!

With a dull sound, the second sword pierced Klein's back.

To such a mysterious thing as not being dry yet, the tears that did not stop overflowing from both Asuna's eyes.

Even while sewed deeply, PoH, the head of the former murder guild "Laughin’ Coffin" looked at the desperate-looking Klein who still move on the ground with his right hand trying to reach the man wearing the black poncho.

"Oh, I have not seen it. A small fish is like a small fish, but I do not mind getting it caught, it will come out so much, so I will see such a thing"

Spreading both hands, swinging his head just beside him, a red knight playing behind Klein tells them something in an inaudible language to Asuna. One of the players nods and sprinkles a new sword.

At that time, the third blade shone brightly to blow away Klein's HP, which seems to be just a little left.

"Jungji!" — Ma-Tsu!

Along with a scream that seems to be in Korean language, a red knight, who ran valorously from the back side of the crowd, took the slash that Klein was supposed to take down with his own sword.

***

_Shhhh ... ... ... why does it hurt so much?!_

Jo Wol-saeng / Moonphase endured the back pain from a cut by a man in black poncho, while falling on the ground.

The Amusphere used by the monthly student should generate only a very low level of pain sensation. Indeed, in the "Shira Empire" which is playing by the time, even when the avatar was crushed from the head at the end of a huge dragon, it was only enough to feel a shock resembling numbness.

Nevertheless, Wolsaeng now feels intense pain like had been broiled with a burner.

No, the pain when I got the same wound in the real world is probably not this. The black poncho man waved at a speed that was too slow to respond to the monthly students who confessed a heinous weapon reminiscent of thick walled kitchen knife as a veteran player who is a reasonable one. In reality, if you eat such an attack, you probably will be killed instantly, and if you did not had been killed, you should have a severe enough pain that you cannot keep conscious, so this pain is only a virtual pseudo feeling in the end.

But even though I know that, unbearable things are unbearable. I want to abandon the situation and log out right away.

However, the monthly student continued to endure the pain while curling his body evenly on top of the black soil.

Because, I cannot persuade.

Japanese hackers "attack" the test server of a new work VRMMO-RPG jointly developed by volunteers of the United States, China, Korea, and killing developers in the game world. I want you to fight together to stop the violence of the Japanese.

Wolsaeng together with other Korean and Chinese players dive to this VRMMO in response to such a call at the social network. And indeed, I saw a scene that the group of Japanese players attacked and annihilated the group thought that it was an American.

But — was it really the sight that the caller was explaining?

In the eyes of the Wolsaeng, the Japanese desperately wanted, the American who was being attacked looked more like a game feeling. The impression is that the tactical situation is reversed by tens of thousands of Koreans and Chinese, "reinforcements", and the Japanese people are almost ineffective and still remains unchanged. Even if the equipment is destroyed and HP is about to run out, they are still desperately trying to do something... ...so, I feel like I'm trying to preserve it rather than to break it.

A female player who speaks native Korean in the Japanese group, Siyne, just before Wolsaeng was slain by a man of black poncho:

"You are deceived. This server belongs to Japanese companies, we are legitimate connectors. You have been given fake information and are being deceived by the development."

There was something that appeals strongly to Wolsaeng in the voice and expression of the female player who calls Siyne. In the midst of fighting, he approached her with difficulty and asked, "Is there a way to prove your story?", and when Siyne's companion tries to say something in Japanese, the man in black poncho stabbed Wolsaeng so it was impossible for him to get up.

The subsequent development was swift and unilateral. The Japanese players were overwhelmed by the deep red army, most of them were forcibly logged out by losing all their HP, and less than two hundred survivors were robbed of weapons and then collected in one place.

The black poncho man who appeared again in the front row thought agaom whether to make a victory declaration or a strange behavior.

I started with sitting in a wheelchair in a group supposed to be a support force of Japanese players | and taking out a black clothing player holding two swords | and started talking to them actively in Japanese.

In the case of which...

It felt something was wrong again that Monday's life was new.

In the virtual world - What does a wheelchair do within a VRMMO?

Even the "Shirra Empire" played by Wolsaeng sometimes which makes it impossible to walk freely if you are hit by a regional damage on the foot or is subjected to disabled debuff, it is still completely magical. Using medicines, or over time and it will completely recover. If you cannot walk for as long as you need and require a wheelchair, you cannot call it a game penalty anymore.

Besides, the young man in black clothes seems to also have some obstacles towards his consciousness. Even if you shake your body to any reaction to the call of black poncho, it will be kept as it is. It seems even if it is the NPC power, the aviator of the crust without the flayer connected.

Eventually the man in black poncho, as if he is frustrated, hung a wheel on the wheelchair's silver rings, and kicked it down without mercy. At that moment, Wolsaeng lost his breath by forgetting his back pain, and a few slightly embarrassed voices leaked from the surrounding Korean players.

The young man who fell to the ground showed a spontaneous response at last.

Of the two swords that he had held till then, he stretched his left hand towards the white sword. At that moment Wolsaeng realized that his right arm was lost from his shoulders.

But his hand did not reach it in time. It is because the man in black poncho who picked up the sword first lifted it slightly to an elevated position so that he could tinker with the child. The young person tries to regain his swords as hard as they crawl. The man in black poncho grabs its left arm and pulls up roughly. Then, while screaming for something, he hits the young man twice with his right hand, with three hits each.

Unexpectedly, a new scream sounded.

A man, wearing an armor like Samurai, who is a Japanese player being restrained, with a bandanna wrapped around his head, tried to grab the black poncho.

Immediately afterwards, however, the sword of the Korean players | was swung down from behind and pierced deeply through the body of Samurai. Although he ought to have suffered from severe pain much worse than Wolsaeng’s, he still tried to move forward, but the second sword hampered it.

A black poncho turns a distorted smile to the samurai man who was skewered. He ordered red knights in Korean language.

"He is an obstacle, kill him."

One of the Red Knight nodded, and swung the third sword.

I could not kept silent any longer. Although Siyne 's explanation is not convincing enough to believe that it is true, at least the man in black poncho's obligation to make a wheelchair as a footballing obligation is inevitable, and conversely from the desperate behavior of the samurai man, a friend. The idea that I want to protect is strongly conveyed.

Jo Wolsaeng cannot be said to have a good image toards the country Japan. Apart from historical and territorial issues of the past, it is closed and despotic in many ways, as if they were the first countries of East Asia to behave. It is the appearance that The Seed consolidated body is blocked from Korea and China even though it is open to Europe and the United States.

But.

The Japanese as a whole should not be considered equal with every Japanese. In the PC games before the release of VRMMO, there was also a title that established a few international services but there were also Japanese players that made unpleasant thoughts, but conversely they enjoyed and played along well. Of course, of course.

Wolsaeng now hates the black poncho guy and hopes to believe in Siyune and the Samurai man. Even it is a Japanese or a Korean, it does not matter. However, simply, I hear a voice crying that I should do this.

The moment I moved, again my eyes got dizzy from my back and pierced my head, but I stood up tying up my teeth and standing up. Pull out the sword and breathe in my chest until it is full of air.

"Stop it!!"

While yelling at a loud volume to everyone, Wolsaeng kicked off the ground.

The status of a given Red Knight avatar is average, and it is heavier than the Speed-type "Moonphase" usually used in Shira Empire. However, wondering what kind of force it is, Wolsaeng is now running through the wilderness with gusty momentum, and took the sword that was about to come down and kill the samurai man with his own sword.

"You ... ... what are you?!"

The red knight in front of us was astonished and it was doubled when shouted in angry Korean. If it was Chinese, it was impossible to communicate, but Wolsaeng tries hard to persuade her not to waste this modest luck.

"Don't you think that something is strange?! The fight has ended already! Even so, why do you need to imitate such a sentence like this?!"

The player who heard it became silent for a moment and turned his eyes towards the young samurai behind Wolsaeng who was supposed to be executed. The eyes behind the visor repeatedly blinks, as if he is watching the sun. After all, as this player's enthusiasm to fight to go down, it seems that he is beginning to feel embarrassed. The slashing force gradually escapes from the sword.

However, before Wolsaeng repeats his words, sharp voices came out of the crowd surrounding that place.

"Traitor!"

"Kill him!!"

A red knight in front of me grasped the sword again as if his back was pushed by the anger of his brothers.

But the next thing I heard was unexpected words that came up of his mouth.

In the case of:

"Wait! Let's hear the story!"

"Certainly, that poncho man is overdoing it!"

Looking at the people around the crowd, Korean players are starting to discuss with the others. The burning flame spreads in the midst of burning field and the Japanese who survived will also be killed, divided into moderate factions to wait until the circumstances are explained to be reasonable. Similar conflicts also propagate to the Chinese people, but they do not know the meaning, but a sharp shouting voice flies in the wilderness.

What is this situation, how will the only commander put it?

Given that, Wolsaeng turns around.

A black poncho man standing by a young man who fell down to the ground was distorting the mouth of the hood deeply while turning around with a thick knife-type dagger in his fingertips.

A bit of time later, he took notice to realize that the facial expressions were not anger, but laughter. On the back of the monthly lunar, a cold shiver ran over the pain.

A black poncho man is never a stakeholder of a game co-developed by Chinese, Korean and US. It is doubtful that such a game exists in the first place. Although the person's identity is unknown, simply letting the fight between each country's players | in this battlefield where real blood and pain exist, ... let's kill each other. That is his purpose.

"……Demon"

Jo Wolsaeng heard that such blurry voices cried out of himself.

Vasago Casals was born in the Tenderloin district, San Francisco's slum area, between the Hispanic mother and the Japanese father.

In the United States, the obviously disadvantage of the child is rejected by the receiving organization of the birth notification. So mother named Vasago instead of Devil and Satan. The official accepted it without knowing that it was the name of the minor devil called "the prince of hell".

There is only one reason for a mother to give a child a name of devil. Because I was born though I did not want it - because I hated it more.

I do not know the details about how my parents met, but I do not want to know, but if I express it briefly, it seems to be "bought with money". Pregnancy was unplanned, mothers wanted abortion, but father parents ordered them to give birth. Then, only father loved the baby, so it was not such a thing, sometimes it comes to checking the state of health, I never brought any toys to the souvenir. What he gave to Vasago is about the ability to speak Japanese.

I understood why his father did not abort Vasago and gave minimal child support cost when Vasago became 15 years old.

The father's family had a child suffering from a congenital kidney, he was told to be a donor for him. I could not refuse. But Vasago put out one condition. I want to live in Japan, my father's motherland. As fulfilling the role of donor will no longer be worthy of Vasago for his father, so I do not know how long he will get the money. I could only imagine a future that would become a seller of Dragons even if I stayed in the slums as it is, then I wanted to leave the country all the time and redo everything.

The father caught the conditions and Vasago got a passport and an airchat in exchange for the left kidney. It was more severe fate to have been waiting for Vasago who went to Japan without giving her mother a farewell speech.

Under Japanese law, complicated procedures and strict examination are imposed on international adoption, and even if adoption is established temporarily, children older than six years can not be granted status of residence. Therefore, from the beginning Vasago had only the way to live in the back company.

Vasago was picked up by a Korean criminal organization and the organization educated him as an assassin, giving fake ID to Vasago who can speak English, Spanish and Japanese.

The tenth task of Vasago, who succeeded nine times of "work" in the five years until becoming 10 years old, was completely different from that before.

If you can never approach the opponent in the real world, kill him in the virtual world.

I did not understand anything at all when I  was said that at the beginning, but after finally hearing the outline of the "SAO incident" that occurred a few days ago, I could understand it. The target involved in the incident is nursing at home where security is severe and never comes out absolutely. I do not know when I will die if I leave it to the death game, there is a possibility that I will escape without dying. However, if you dive into the same game and zero your opponent's HP, Naive Gear will kill you in the real world.

Still, there were still three big problems.

The assassin, Vasago, can not log out until the game is cleared, that it really dies in the game if it dies, and that Vasago himself can not attack the target. As long as there was evidence of assassination remaining in the log of who attacked who, whoever had the trouble, the organization presented a tremendous amount as compensation for the task. Vasago thought that it is unlikely that it will actually be paid even if it succeeds, but in any case he did not have the right to veto.

Most unused Nerve gears were seized by the police, but the organization has obtained one from somewhere. There is no way for police or development company to stop logging if there is only SAO's software and intention to jump into the game of death by himself. The last and unexpected difficulty is the character 1 name, Vasago without having played video game etc. decided the name, but it was "PoH" from the origin of the real name given to the mother.

The true virtual world that I experience for the first time has transformed or released the personality of Vasago. The surrounding Japanese players were able to remind the fathers and their families who had forgotten for years and finally realized the power of how much I hated them all East Asians.

Because it's work, I kill the target. However, other players | kill as much as possible.

Vasago decided so, organized SAO's largest homicide guild "Laughin’ Coffin" to take away the enormous number of players in addition to the original target. When getting tired of steering the guild which became oversized eventually, it hit the capture group and destroyed it and destroyed it and decided to be the greatest prey, and it was about to finally start to move oneself towards the killing of "Flash" and "Black swordsman" It has been cleared.

The first thing Vasago returned from the death game to the real world was not joy but collapse and disappointment. I decided to pursue the same experience and return to America, knowing that I can never return to that dreamy world. Paying the appointed fee, killing the boss of the organization who was reluctant, taking the money and going to the United States, he crawled into the Cyber Operation section of a private military company based in San Diego.

Vasago, who fully demonstrated the technologies forged by SAO in the VR battle training of the guards and marines, was instantly selected as a teacher, but even if you get a stable life that is not comparable to the past My heart was not filled.

Once again. I want to go to that world only once more. Everything is a digital creature, hence human nature becomes exposed, to the truth world covered with lies.

As soon as I wished to do so, in a terribly realistic virtual world named underworld,

It is no longer a miracle to say that it was a miracle but to say that it was a fate that we could meet again and again, "Flash" and "Black swordsmen".

It seems that the spirit is now being modulated for some reason, but if you kill the surrounding players from one end, the swordsmen will surely wake up. As a result of such a man, Vasago - PoH was more attracted to a Black Swordsman than any other person I met. If you can kill this man with your own hand, you can think that you can kill yourself shortly afterwards.

First of all, we will sink Chinese and Koreans who drew into underworld with fake information and put them in the ocean of blood. Of course, I do not think that a quick lie will last long. A considerable number of people already have a sense of incompatibility in the situation and are beginning to argue with those who are still burning with patriotism. Just scatter a small spark at the moment the tension reaches the limit.

In a place that is a little far away, the Korean player who gave a strike earlier is trying to persuade my brother. If you drop the neck of that guy and cowards who are cowardly kill you, scream, you will easily sweat sweet patrippers swiftly.

"Wait, are you going to wake up soon?"

Vasago whispered to a black swordsmen who fell on the ground with an empty expression. Now that the profile of the youngster resembles somewhere to the older brother who had a glimpse of just a moment just before the kidney transplant surgery, before he turned back to him.

First of all, if you kill "Black Swordsman" and "Flash" in this world and log out, I will withdraw. Then find the two people who are supposed to be somewhere in the Ocean Turtle, kill them as much as they pour out the greatest affection.

Just imagining that moment, I felt relieved pain on my left side, which had never been erased since I was robbed of my kidney at the age of 15.

I smile at the back of the hood and whisper to the young man lying on the floor.

"While you are sleeping, everyone will die, I beg you, please get up early."

While swallowing sword "Friend cut knife" on the right-hand side, Vasago slowly started walking.

***

_I will do it._

Asuna who lost the power of the soul reached the sound where someone's shoe sole was dry and stepping on the ground.

_It's okay, it's okay._ Machine sound like inorganic, but rhythmical to dance. Once, I heard it a few times at a floating castle without now, footsteps of the deceased god.

As I raised my face, I saw a silhouette of black poncho walking towards here, from the side of Kirito lying in a place about 20 meters away.

No, it is not Asuna that I am aiming for. Klein is penetrated by the two swords on the right side. I wonder if you intend to stick yourself to a samurai who seems to be almost dead only by aerial power.

Asuna who thought so for a while, I immediately felt it was different.

Near the fallen Klein, two of the red armor knights are actively discussing in Korean that can not be understood by Asuna. If you notice, the survivors of the Japanese players and the tens of thousands of large armies surrounding the underworld troops seems to be fighting fiercely there.

Perhaps the player who still believes the word of POH is condemning the player he noticed. With just this, something a little triggered, the former could pull the sword towards the latter. If that happens, the chain of hatred will spread to the player of the Allied Chinese and Korean Army. Possibly, POH is about to stop it.

Wrong. Wrong.

That man intends to put a fire on himself against a new conflict that is spreading to the battlefield.

Like when he directed the capture group to the location of the hideout of the homicide guild "Laughin’ Coffin" that he made, to produce a bloody slayer fight.

I do not know what it is going to get until I cut my own effort by half. However, I am confident that something will be bad and something bad will happen.

POH instructed something in Korean while walking slowly.

The two who were detaining Klein grabbed another person to shake off a momentary confusion and robbed freedom of both arms.

The death god of black poncho makes a sound rash and grips a thick knife.

To execute himself "traitor" and put its head down, in order to attack the buddies by inciting incoming Chinese Korean players who believe in himself.

Do not allow such imitation. For the ultimate goal of protecting the underworld people, you should not stop stopping fellowship of red knights, but it is still over ten thousand where we have halved. Moreover, they will have more anger and hostility than ever before, and they will try to turn it towards Japanese and underworld people.

Above all, half of the Chinese-Korean players trying to be killed by PoH's incendiary are aware of the neck truth of this world ... they are those who believed in the Japanese player's words. I will never forgive them, such as abandoning them.

I have to move. Standing up and constructing a sword, I have to stop executing POH.

But, neither the hands nor the legs enter. Every time I breathe, innumerable scratches I receive throughout my body suffered severely and I kill my energy.

_...... No ... I can not stand it._

While kneeling on dry ground, Asuna exhaled breathlessly.

Roll slowly back. Dirt, frayed hair slides down from the shoulder and blocks visibility.

While listening to the footsteps of the death gods approaching at last, I tried to close both eyes that tears blurred - at that time.

_I love you._

_I will stand it instead of you, Asuna._

Someone's voice hoarse faintly, but definitely.

Someone's hand wrapped both shoulders gently but powerfully.

Warm light flows into my body. A refreshing wind blows the whole body pain.

_Now, stand up, Asuna. To protect precious things._

Asuna 's right hand moved swiftly, crawling on the ground, he smashed what was standing there.

In the case of

Pattern of Genesis God 's sword "Radiant Light".

As I raised my face, the death god of black poncho sprinkled at least a kitchen knife that flickers like blood like red. The restrained red knight squatted his whole body as if he had been driven by fear. The bustle of the surroundings fell all the time, countless sight lines concentrated on ruthless blades.

Asuna kicked the ground, stopping breathing, eating and tying the teeth, gathering all of the remaining power.

"Aaaaaaa!"

Pull out the rapier on your right hand with a bullshit like a blood. A white flash flashes from the top of the bottom. Basic skills, thousands, tens of thousands of times, sword skill "Linear".

When POH notices the surprise attack of Asuna by the truly reaction,

"Wow"

I let the upper body warp while leaking voice like such. As I looked toward the darkness behind the hood, Asuna thrust hard right hand.

Faint response. Black curly flying dancing in the universe, a few drops of fresh blood splashed from dark-skinned skin ————— ducked!

It is the same for both Incrad and the Underworld that make a big gap after the sword skill is invoked. At the moment, Asuna's torso imposed fatal rigidity, POH's kitchen knocks up and strikes.

At the same time, however, Asuna was concentrating the image at the foot of POH.

The slightly rainbow-colored light emanates from the ground and disappears. Asuna created a few centimeters of protrusions under the axis foot of POH by the power of Genesis Stacy.

It was a small topographical operation, but a pain like lightning stroked through my head. In exchange for the price, the black death god collapsed and the kitchen knife did not severely slit the Asuna dress.

"Rats!"

Asuna, freed from rigidity, pulls back rapier again.

"Wow!"

POH which made Honcho greatly flash up, restores the knife directly above.

God speed technique and rigid slash technique crashed and sprinkled pure white and deep red mixed sparks. While aspiring to possess the power of all, Asuna asked with a blurted voice trying to push back the intersecting blade.

"You ... what do you want?"

The mouth of PoH peeking under the hood distorted grin and disturbing the rough voice.

"It is decided, it is a guy of" black "... It is only this guy's hope from the time I could not be killed trying to kill for the first time in five layers of Incrad.

"... ... why so much hates Kirito, what did he do to you?"

"hate……?"

Repeatedly outside, PoH somewhat made the face closer and whispered.

"I thought that I would understand how much I love him, but in a world in which it was just a shit, only this guy was the only man who can believe unconditionally No matter how hard I am, It did not break, it did not get dirty no matter how I invited, always gave me hope and joy for me. So... I can not allow him to come to such a place without me. I will absolutely wake him up, so for that I will kill thousands of people, tens of thousands, no matter who they are "

The horrible words released from the god of death gods became dark black and entwined with Asuna and tried to rob the fighting spirit.

"Hope ... ...? Pleasure, is that ... .... What did you do, no matter how much Kirito is ...?"

Although the words are returned hardly, the intersection of knife and rapier, which intertwines, gradually approaches Asuna while intermittently scattering the sparks.

It is not just the fact that the fighting spirit of Asuna is shaken. A magical sword presented to the right hand of PoH, Friend Knife is growing in thickness and size little by little while trembling in living things.

It seems that PoH also noticed the startle of Asuna, the darkness behind the hood slowly hurt.

"I finally understood the mechanism of this world, this place, the flowing blood and the lost lives will be the energy in its moment." Light shrine maiden "sprightly Laser dark territory army Be wonderful when burning down. "

As for the system which is the backbone of the underworld, Asuna also got an explanation before dive. That is "spatial resource", but basically it should be able to use complicated maneuvers or equipped with weapons with resource-absorbing abilities. Even if the enlargement of friendship kitchen knife is due to the action of space resources, POH does not tell the command, kitchen knife is probably a compartment of character data of SAO era and has resource-absorbing ability of under-field specification There is not no bad.

But POH continued the word as though he had read that thought of Asuna.

"This" friendship kitchen knife "is a specification that it specs up as much as to slash a human by slashing a human player by speckling down every time Incradder knocks down a monster .... Well, although it seems to evolve into a katana with a similar name if you defeat as much as you can, it is obvious that you are not interested in such a monkey. The point is that the inherent performance that strengthens by sucking human life is underworld in this battlefield, the life of the American troops killed by Anta and others, and the Japanese troops killed by Chinese and Korean Allied Forces are swirling. When they kill each other in the middle Korean, Further mass In the case of The life of me is overflowing. "

Even while the death god whispers, friendship knives keep growing gigantically while growling. Asuna 's "Radiant Light" which is a GM equipped gentle to wonder if it could not withstand pressure. Every background sound is distant, only my breathing and the beat of the heart echoes in my ears.

As if the Lord of the Evil sword is getting taller, PoH said, hanging on Asuna.

"If you exhaust your whole life, the talent will kill the person Fluctlight of this world from one end, only the people trembling behind ...... The monsters in the dark world and the human world I do not know how many tens of thousands are there, but I will probably wake up with sledge like that too, if the talented "black swordsman"

A cold wind swayed the black leather hood and exposed the twin clutches in the back of the dark for just a moment. Slightly glowing, red eyes.

It's a devil. not human. Real, devil.

This is the nature of a man named POH. The mask of the "merry angel" who was wearing in Einclad, and the mask of "a hard commander" who was wearing on this battlefield were all lying. Indeed, a cruel vengeance who only torments all people, torments, and kills ... ....

The power came out of Asuna's knee. Rapier fractures again, the knife blade approaches the throat.

"Do not worry, I will not kill you in the end, just will not let it get in my way anymore ... I will have to see it to you ... ... This guy awakens and in my arms he will die. "

Friend Knife has already giantified to nearly twice the original size. “Radiant Light” emits a high and clear scream and a faint crack runs on the blade.

The view of Asuna with a knuckle and a right knee on the ground was covered with a jet-black fog from the hood. In the darkness, only the thick blade of steel and the crimson eyes shone glitteringly.

Asuna's back on the verge of exhaustion.

Once again, someone's little hand supported it.

It’s all right.

Always because the Bota is near.(??? - いつも、ボタがそばにいるから。) 

From the center of Asuna's chest, blue clear light shriveled and diced.

Asuna saw the pure white wings spread from his back reflected in the blade of a friend cut knife.

All the sounds returned, crossed the battlefields of the battlefield, and the voices of our companions were heard.

"Asuna !! Good luck, Asuna !!"

"Asuna-san !! Asuna !!"

"Stand up, Asuna !!"

"Asuna ...... Go!"

Lizbet. Silica. Egil. Klein.

It is not just fellows. The surviving Sakuya and Alisha and ALO association, Siyune, Sleeping Kights, even the Human defense army knight Renri, Tiese, Ronie, Soltierina, even a lot of juniors and monks have voice to Asuna come.

Thank you everyone.

_Thank you, Yuki._

_I still can fight. Everyone's heart will give me strength._

"I will not lose ...... I am like you, for humans who can only hate ... ... absolutely will not lose!"

At the moment she cried, the wave of white light shook from the whole body of Asuna, pushing back the body of PoH greatly. While standing up, pull the right rapier to maximum. A pale violet flashes reminiscent of the flowers of time are released many times from the blade and dyed the world.

"A depression !!"

Trying to step on the shinigami, trying to lose your body.

Asuna exercised the original sword skill that she received from "Yuki sword" Yuki.

Five times from the upper right. Ultra-fast pounding technique inscribes five bright spots obliquely.

Five times from the top left. Cross with the previous trail, five more lights penetrate.

"Negative ..."

While spitting out the air mixed with fresh blood, PoH let the gigantic kitchen knock out the crimson shine. If directly hit by the power stone 's great stuff, the few remaining HP will definitely erase.

However, Asuna's attack had not ended yet.

"Oooaaaaaaa ... ...!"

Concentrate all the remaining energy at the tip of the rapier to the center of the crossing trajectory, unleash the last ... ... and the biggest blow.

Ten series shoot OSS, "Mother’s Rosary".

A purple shine similar to a meteor penetrated the heart of PoH.

The death god of black poncho danced in the air at the highest, dropping a heavy noise on the far away ground.

Asuna who ran out of all mental power once again asked in his mind while pushing one knee again. ... .... “Thank you, Yuuki”.

There was no answer. Perhaps, from the beginning, it may have been a phantom voice, a phantom hand created by Asuna's memory. Even so, in this world where everything consists of memories,

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0044.jpg)

it is by no means fake.

Yes ... ... Originally, this underword should not be able to use OSS Mother’s Rosary. Even if Higa and Kikuoka introduced the old SAO 's sword skill with The Seed, it is ALO' s Undine Asuna who inherits the Mother’s Rosary, and Stacia Asuna was not converted, so that data is not attached.

But OSS correctly triggered with light effect. If it is said that it is the power of imagination, it is also the truth that Yuki who resurrected whenever from Asuna's memory encouraged us. Because memories will not disappear forever.

PoH 's avatar is still lying on the ground. However, I can not believe that I can live with elegance by ten series of shots by GM equipment. Unlike other players, you should have used STL, so if you died it will not be diversified sooner but corpses will remain for a while like human world people and dark territory inhabitants.

As she stood up to support rapier, Asuna looked back and confirmed the appearance of Klein. Three players who were still detained by still sweeping their belly but still looking at Asuna with a fourth red knight who came to stop executions There.

I wanted to hurry up to Kirito as soon as possible, but firstly she tried to step over there to pull out the sword from Klein's body and heal his wounds ... at that time.

I felt the ground trembled slightly, I felt.

While stuffy breath, I turn around again.

The collapsed PoH does not move at all. However, a friend cut knife held on the right hand emits an extraordinary light mixed with red and black. If you look closely, the air in the battlefield seems to be slowly swirling around the kitchen knife.

"I do not ... ... I am absorbing divine power !!"

That's what I cried out was Soritina, a former head of the human force.

Asuna tied up her teeth and tried to run to destroy the devil sword.

But as soon as possible, the death god of the black clothes raised the body as if it was pulled by a friend cut knife that appears in the air.

The front body of the poncho broke greatly, and the body wrapped in a tight leather suit is exposed. A huge hole opens in the breastplate that hit the final shot of OSS, and you can see the landscape on the far side.

Looking at the appearance of PoH who stood up while being blown entirely of the heart, underworld people leak the voice of fear. Even the Chinese and Koreans who recognize this as a normal VRMMO world are intensely gloomy.

Perhaps the friend knife will absorb a large amount of spatial resources and convert it to HP of PoH. While presuming that, Asuna could not stop trembling the whole body.

PoH is diving using STL.

Then, you should feel the same level of pain as in the real world. Even when Asuna was pierced by his spear with his spears, I could have felt pain like it was going to be fainted, but I can not imagine what kind of pain it can open a large hole in the middle of my chest.

But the god of death shrieked with a loud voice like a trembling laugh at the lips dripping blood - shaking the whole battlefield.

"This is the nature of the Japanese! This is a weak traitor ... and destroy all the dirty Japanese people, all alone!"

Although it should be in Korean, somehow the meaning of the word could be clearly recognized by Asuna.

A red-black aura struck from a friend knife covered with PoH at the most, spreading to the end of the wilderness.

Sai-sai-sai-sai…

Sai-sai-sai-sai-sai-sai-sai!!

Half of Chinese-Korean players pushed up the sword in the same way and made a ferocious cry.

Means to stop attacking the moderates who were trying to persuade them ... and a part of it to stop trying to attack the Japanese players survival and towards underworld troops Asuna did not have any more.

Suddenly thrust away from behind, it falls to the ground. The rapier full of scratches leaves the right hand and rolls on dry soil. 

Before and after that, young people with black hair were trying to stretch their left hand hard to Asuna.

"Kirito - kun"

Dazzling, Asuna also waited for the last time while giving a right hand to a loved one.
