## Part 7

I looked around my room that I came back for the first time in two months.

The PC desk and the wall rack. Pipe bed, plain curtain.

Nostalgic ... ... I think it is strange for its stormy view before I think. As a matter of fact, it is the first time in a year and eight months in a subjective sense to see this room. And in total, I spent two and a half years in Underworld.

In my room at the North Centoria Sword Art Academy, it was cozy with plenty of wooden furniture, beautiful carpets, paintings' foreheads and flower arrangement and made me entertain the eye.

As a matter of fact, Ronnie and Teise, who were our valets, and then ... the beautiful smile of Yujio, next to them.

Painful feeling in chest, which should have changed into memories, vividly revives, I clog my throat.

Drop clothes bags on the floor, make a few more steps and sit down on the bed. If you lay the body sideways, it's just dried up, there is a smell of sun from the sheets.

Close your eyes.

A faint voice echoes in the back of my ear.

— If you are taking a nap, do not do it until the practice of sacred art is over. Are you planning to copy me again?

— Yes, I've tried tweaking the technique I learned during this time. Let's go to the training ground later.

— Oh, I went out again and bought some sweets! Here, have some!

— Look, get up, Kirito.

— Kirito ... ....

I slowly rotated the body and buried my face in the pillow.

Since I woke up at RATH Roppongi branch, I still enduring this.

I grasped the bedsheet, tied it and bound the teeth. I cried up with a loud voice. Tears flowing without stopping like a child, trembled, cried alone.

Because —.

Can’t be worse, all the memories were erased!

All, since I woke up all alone in the forest, walked around the banks of the stream, led by axe sound, and met a boy under a black big tree, all of the memories of two and a half years!

No matter how much I cried, I kept crying, the tears never ran out.

Eventually, the door was knocked with a low-key sound.

I did not reply, but following the sound the knob turns, a small footstep sounded. The bed got slightly sunk in the immediate vicinity of me staying in the pillow.

The finger caresses my hair carefully.

For me who stubbornly keeps his face down, a gentle but firmly coaxial voice was applied.

"Talk, brother ... That was the world, fun things, sad things, everything"

"... ...."

I was still silent for a few seconds.

When I turned my face to the right after a while, in the field of shedding tears, a smile of a single leaf of Suguha came up.

I came back. Home. To the family.

The past is far away, and it is going on now. Just briefly, to the front, to the front.

After closing my eyes and wiping my tears, I opened my lips shivering.

"... When I first met in the middle of a deep forest, he was just a lumber.

I thought it was incredible, he was trying to cut down only one cedar tree over 300 years, for generations ... "

It was August 16th 2026 when I came back home in Saitama Prefecture Kawagoe City after rehabilitation.

That night, spending a whole round, I told Suguha about what happened in the underworld (//I guess he told her what he still remembers only, right?/). The next morning, I was woken up by a phone call.

It was a news from RATH Roppongi branch that Alice had disappeared.

***

Monday, August 17th 2026, 9am.

"... ... ... disappeared!? Fluctlight, is that what you mean?"

I kept clutching the mobile terminal pulling on t-shirt.

Dr. Koujiro across the line answered with a constantly strained voice while being suppressed.

『No ... ... entire machine body, OK? According to the video of the surveillance camera, it seems like she got out of security lock by herself last night and stole the security guard's keys and got out .』

"Did it herself ...?"

I exhale a little bit of my breath.

Currently, organizations and groups that are not happy about the existence of Alice will not be counted with fingers of both hands in Japan. Furthermore, if you count individuals wanting to destroy her for pragmatic, religious, creed or emotional reasons, you can not guess that number. If you were kidnapped by such a person, you can not use the sword or the sacred art, so now she has no means of protecting herself.

Because RATH also recognizes it, the security system of the Roppongi branch has been raised to the firmness of a little fortress. However, indeed it was a blind spot until Alice voluntarily disappeared.

The other point is why Alice ran into such a ruin —.

One week before, as soon as the vocal chat received in ALO is cut off, the word she leaked out revives to the mind.

In my ears, a painful exaggerated voice of Dr. Koujiro arrives.

『I was worried that Alice had an overwhelming burden. But are not you tired? Do not want to take a day off? Whatever I ask, she just shake her head with a smile .... 』

"Oh yes ... ... That's right, that proud knight will not blow someone a weak tone." 

『Except only one person, except you. ...... Kirigaya, I think Alice will definitely contact you. So .... Although you just went out of the hospital, I'm sorry, but ... 』

I quickly replied to the doctor who makes the ending muddy.

"Yes, I understand, if I’m contacted by Alice, I will be able to get there soon .... But ... Doctor, Alice can move so long distance?"

『We are also worried about it. With built-in battery alone, even if it is full charge, if you walk for about eight hours, if you run it will not keep that half. If you can not move anywhere near Roppongi ... ... If you find it there to an unfriendly person ... 』

"Because of her look ... ...."

It pulls a face again to a new uneasiness factor. Alice's dazzling blond hair, clear white skin, and a beautiful face finished with a spirit of expert craftsmen are noticeable despite being a robot.

『Now, all of the available staff are searching around this area. I am also monitoring the writing of the net, I am also going into the public surveillance camera network and recording checking. 』

"If you do, I will go there for the moment as well, so it would be better to move immediately when there is contact."

『I will be saved if you do so. Please do it, Kirigaya-kun 』

And the call was disconnected in a hurry.

I pulled out the clothes appropriately from the closet and as soon as I thrust my hands and feet, I took off the backpack and the mobile terminal, the keys of the bike and jumped out of my room.

Running down the stairs, the first floor is quiet and rebounding. Father and Mother at the Obon Festival, had said that they would go out with two other people; and Suguha would be doing a morning practice of the Kendo. It seems that my family will celebrate my return with energy tonight, but honestly it is not so late.

Drank the orange juice in the fridge and dash to the entrance with the mouth full of bagel sandwich seems to have left specially for me. I thrust my feet in the shoes and grabbed the door knob, and the intercom near me immediately rang.

For a moment my heart jumps. No way — did Alice move so far by some means?

"Ali ... ..."

I was standing on the other side of the door that unlocked while mouthing.

There was nothing but a courier who solidified himself in a blue uniform and a hat.

The bad thing between the bad things. Although it is unlikely, if you see the sweat balls floating on the face that greets you brightly, saying "Hey, got a parcel for you!" It can not be said that you can leave it behind.

To my grabbed stamper style standing on top of the shoe box, the courier added further trouble.

"Luggage, cash on delivery, I say!"

"Ah ... .... hi"

After trying to remove the wallet from the backpack, I remember that this world certainly had a useful thing called electronic money. Pull out the mobile terminal from your pocket and hold it over the tablet you give to courier.

"Next time!"

I went out waiting to see my parcel left behind and I confirmed it is left at the front door. Unexpectedly heavy. A corrugated cardboard box that has about seventy-five centimeters on a side. If you are not empty, I will leave this way and check your invoice while thinking about going out. Goods are electric products. The sender is —.

"None ......"

Ocean Resources Exploration Research Organization, printed on the boxd with Mincho font. Is it a box that is stocked at RATH Roppongi branch? In the address field, my address and full name. I have not seen awkwardly handwritten address.

_If the luggage that Dr. Koujiro issued, I would have touched it on a previous phone. Then, was it sent by Kikuoka or Higa? When it comes to content, underworld, or some mechanical related STL?_ I plucked my lips and got a finger on the seal of the gum tape.

Pull carefully. Lift the lid slightly lifted, gently to the left and right - open ... ....

"... ... Wow Aaaa !!"

And I screamed in horror.

It was packed tightly in the box and bent in an unnatural direction, it is human's limbs.

I spread my eyes wide open my eyes and I was forced to scream a second time.

"Gaaa!"

With the darkness of the gap between the limbs, one eye opened up and the stare at me straight.

The white wrist that stretched out of the corner of the corrugated cardboard box was stretched out from the box.

Before I screamed the third time, I heard somewhat known voice.

"Do not you pull me out quickly, because it is not that bad here, Kirito"

Three minutes later.

I sat down in the hall of my house and held my head with both hands.

Although I tried to struggle in order to make my thought somehow struggle to this situation that the motif, "beautiful girl robot delivered by parcel delivery service" which has been used in many fiction for a long time, has become real.

"……Can you do it!!"

Shouting, abandoning efforts, standing up quickly.

At the turning point, a beautiful girl robot who dressed in a familiar uniform  is shouldering in the corridor a pillar casually.

Eventually, seeing me in the morning, robot — exactly named "Electroactive Muscule • Operating Machine No. 3" authentic bottom-up AI, Alice Synthesis • Thirty Integrity Knight of the Underworld Axiome Church stands with a smile.

"This house is built of wood, as if it were a house in the forest of Rurid, it is much better than that one"

"Oh ... yeah ... ... Maybe seven or eight decades will pass ..."

When answering without power, I will focus on the blue eyes so long.

"Well, of course it’s all about destiny! But I’m sure they use fine trees...."

"That's right ...... I mean ......"

In a nutshell I walked through the corridor, grabbed Alice 's shoulder, and when I tried to ask her what I wanted to know when she smiled again.

"First of all, could not you please restore the power of this steel body? Uh ...... In this word, I think that it’s called " Charging "”.

That’s right.

"The beautiful girl robot sent by courier charges with household outlet" is reality.

While I was diving to an underworld, Real World came to the future as well.

"Oh ... recharging ... ... please, as much as you want ..."

I pushed Alice 's shoulder and took me to the living room.

Alice was standing with her spine leaned over the sofa with one end of recharging cable stuck in the wall power outlet and another end of plugged in left hip bone, and still looking around the surroundings.

— In the meantime Alice will not eat or drink at last after she charges on so I can’t even brew tea, what to do... It seems that I'm still violently fluctuating.

In order to calm down, open your mouth to dissolve from doubt as imminent in the near future.

"Well ... ... First of all, I wonder how I realized how to make yourself with courier service away, from there ..."

Then a beautiful blonde girl with blue eyes said that hearing hesitant things said, shrugging his shoulders and replied.

"It's easy"

Of course.

In the Roppongi branch, Alice who prepared the invoice payment invoice, packing tape and strengthened oversized cards cardboard boxes, firstly recorded the image of the surveillance camera who left the room on the video of the surveillance camera.

After that, assemble the box outside the entrance camera view, paste the invoice with my address, and enter the box while unlocking each joint. Paste the tape only on one side of the top lid, and tighten the lid by pulling it from the inside. Furthermore, temporarily fix the lid with tape from inside.

Do so, ask the courier to collect the cargo by e-mail. Of course, the dealer got checked by a security guard at the gate, but the mail was certainly sent from inside the building, and the entrance has the baggage properly. Without knowing that a girl robot lurks in there, the dealer tightly patches a little sticky tape, collects the luggage, puts it on the truck, and delivers it to Kawagoe-shi, Saitama prefecture the next morning ...... .

"……I see……"

I dull while slipping down into the sofa.

After all, Alice did not go out of the building of Roppongi branch in a way even one step. It is no wonder that you can not grasp the steps taken.

However, it is surprising that Alice which was only one month after visiting the real world could have thought of it rather than the cleverness of the signature. When I put the question up, the girl in her uniform wears her shoulder up and down again.

"When I was apprenticed just as a knight, I had sneaked out of cathedral with this hand and saw the city."

"... ... that, that sort of thing"

With this, when will Alice become proficient in information technology, when will it be? In a sense, she is a child of a network that can instantly dive into virtual space without AmuSphere.

— As I felt aside the terrible imagination aside, when I properly sit on the sofa, I gave a fundamental question to him.

"But ... .... Alice ... When do you want to, why, if you just came to my house, if you talked to Dr. Rinko, I think that time has been made"

"That's right, that person is a nice person ... ...She is very concerned about myself. Even though I got the opportunity to visit Kirito's house, I suppose it was supposed that a platoon of black ops comes along.

I can not believe artifacts, thin eyelashes are lying down.

"...... I think that I am sorry that I imitate escaping like this ... Dr. Rinko is very worried and I am searching for me, apologizing how I got it from the way back But ... ... I just got this time by all means I have time to interact with you Kirito who is not a temporary figure and is just for themselves but a genuine body "

A big eyed pupil shot me from the front.

The two blue eyes are supposed to be optical devices composed of sapphire lenses and CMOS image sensors, but they have a breathtakingly beautiful sparkle. It might possibly be connected by a short circuit, the light emitted by her fractal itself.

Alice played with a faint motor driving sound, but got up with smooth motion.

Wrap around the glass table, one step, two steps, approaching me.

So, the chargeable battery stuck on the wall tightly stretched, impeding walking. A faint emptiness appears on a white face.

I breathed in heavily, I got up in the same way.

Go two steps and stand right in front of Alice.

Twin eyes, which are slightly lower than I, have a strong will, and they twinkle. The lips moved, sweet and clear, but a voice with a slightly electronic sound was emitted.

"Kirito. I am angry."

Even without being told what, I got the meaning of the word.

"Yeah ... I guess."

"Why ... Why did not you tell me ... at that time that we might not meet anymore ... This may be an eternal farewell, separated by two sides of the wall of two hundred years, If you tell me one thing at that "altar at the end" that we can not rejoice again, I ... ... I would not escape alone! "

Alice screamed, with a facial expression that would have been colored by a drop that definitely would not stop unless the machine body had a function to shed tears.

"I am a knight! My way is fighting! Even though ... Why did you choose to confront that terrible enemy alone, did not you hope for me next to that! For you I ... ... Alice • Synthesis • damn it Thirty!! "

A little fist lifted clasped my chest. Once again. One more time.

A small head slumped trembling and the forehead hit the left shoulder.

I gently wrapped golden hair with both hands.

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0355.jpg)

"You ... is my hope"

I slowly murmured.

"It's not just for me, it's an irreplaceable hope for a lot of people who lived and died in that world, so I absolutely wanted to protect and I did not want to lose ... hope ... for the future "

"……future……"

A wet voice sounded in my arms.

"What kind of shape is the future, I will continue to endure the loneliness that will not run out in this chaotic real world, the body of the disabled steel in the endless feast. In the end, what is there? "

"... .... I'm sorry, I do not know it now."

With power in both arms, I tried hard to convey my emotions and thoughts at least for a long time.

"But when you are here, the world will change, you will change, at the end you are going to change, Cardinal, Administrator and Bercouli, the Eldri ... ... when the wish of Yujio will be rewarded I do believe that you come. "

That is not all. Once in another world ...... The lives of many young people who lived and fought and died in the virtual sky floating castle were also caught in this place, this moment.

Alice kept silent for a long, long while holding his forehead on my shoulder.

Eventually, the different knight who gently released his body smiled a smile with a resolute smile, just as it was when he met in the Tower of Chalk.

"... ... I have to contact Dr. Rinko, I am sorry if I let her worry too much."

I continued watching Alice 's eyes for a while still. I felt that I felt tightened feeling has not disappeared yet.

But what more can I do for you? Or it may be a problem that can only be solved by taking time.

"... Yeah, that's right."

I nodded, I pulled out the mobile from my pocket.

Dr. Koujiro who was up-to-the-point on the phone, as expected despite quitting about five seconds, the word that she first said was an apology to Alice. After all, she is a really nice person. The only woman whom Kayaba Akihiko has allowed in his lifetime.

"...... I did not care enough, rather, we were forcing Alice."

Following herself, Dr. Koujiro told me unexpected directions.

I turned off the phone and smiled at Alice looking at me carefully.

"So she said “Sorry”, then was “sorry for that”, okay, then “I am so sorry”, so.... Today you should stay overnight "

"Is it true?"

Alice's face quickly changed to happy expression.

"Yeah, but I told her you will turn on the GPS tracker for sure."

"It's a modest price at that prize"

I nodded, once she made a long blink, Alice got up quickly.

"If you decide so, please show me this house and garden first. It is the first time to actually see the real world's traditional buildings."

"Oh, no problem ... ... but it's just a private house, so I do not see much of it ..."

After twisting my neck, I can think of it.

"Oh, come on, do you go out in the garden for a moment"

Waiting for Alice to finish charging, get out of the entrance and go to the yard of the ball grass.

To the knight who turns interests to carp and goldfish's swimming ponds, the pine-tree walls, etc., whilst explaining these things, it is —.

It was a quiet dojo built in the northeast corner of the site.

Alice, as he took off her shoes and went up to the boarded floor, seemed to have seen what it was building for. Look quickly and tell me to hurry.

"This is ... .... It's a training ground, is not it?"

"Yes, we’re calling it dojo here,"

"Dojo ... ...."

Alice who mumbled this and turned to the front went through the underworld integrity knight greeting: hit the right hand to the chest and the left hand to the waist. I also bowed in the Japanese style, then go side by side.

The deceased grandfather who built the floor, which only Suguha uses of the kendo, was polished by the black light. Even though it is midsummer, my bare feet are coolly cold. It feels like somewhere different up to the air.

Alice first saw the hanging scroll over the front wall, then walked up to the shelf next to it.

Stretch your right hand and lift the old bamboo sword one time.

"This is ... .... It is a wooden piece for training, but it is quite different from that of underworld."

"Yeah, they made it out of bamboo and devised it so that I do not get hurt seriously. The regular wooden sword could cut down about 30% of my life."

"Well ... .... There is no immediate curative technique here, so it will be a hard work for the sword's training ... ...."

After nodding deeply, Alice was silent for a few seconds.

And suddenly.

She turned around and, surprisingly, I handed out the handle of the bamboo sword I had.

"What? ...."

"There is only one thing to do at the training ground."

"Oh ...... Yeah! Really!?"

At that time Alice was grabbing another bamboo sword with her left hand. I will be forced to grasp the protruding handle.

"And ... ... Alright, you, your body ... ...."

"Do not care!"

Harshness.

And a sharp but hilarious word.

I looked at a machine girl walking on a boarded floor, while holding a half open.
