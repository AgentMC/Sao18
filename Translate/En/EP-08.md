## Part 8

—— So I thought.

Until certain moment in the night of August 17, the moment when I fell into a gentle sleep in my bed.

"... ... Kirito, please get up, Kirito"

I shook my shoulder and I was pulled back from a slump full of sweet acidic sentiment.

"……Hmm……"

While leaking a scratched voice out of my throat, lift the eyelids unpleasedtly.

Immediately there, I found the azure eye colored with golden eyelashes and froze on the sheets.

"What the ......!? ... .... Oh, Alice ...... !?"

"Shoo, do not make a loud voice"

"This is a bit, so to say, inappropriate ... ..."

"What are you thinking about?"

She pulled my left ear with ‘HMmmm’, so the conscious begins to awake.

With the sleepy eyes, once again I looked at the bedside clock, it turned a bit after 3 o'clock. Outside the window, there is still a moon shining at a high position.

Return the line of sight.

Alice kneeling at the bedside while being illuminated by the dazzling moonlight, was a very unfavorable appearance with only a blue T-shirt. From the long hem, white legs as if themselves emitting light are undoubtedly exposed. The junction lines which should run thin on the silicon skin can not be seen in this darkness at all, and it was hard to believe that elegant curves is a man-made object at all.

"... ... Hey, do not look too much"

I pulled my throat and jumped up again while a figure pulling down the shirt's hem.

Although I forcibly lifted the line of sight, this time bulges that lift the thin fabric and hair like molten gold that flows over it will enter the eye and the thought will decelerate suddenly.

My understanding was it is the first time I upset her so easily, but Alice apparently also feeling embarrassed at last, said looking sideways and sharpening her lips.

"...... I do not remember that, when you and I were sleeping in the same bed for six months, you would have such a reaction at all."

"Oh ... ... that, is that so?"

"That is right!!"

After crying, she held her mouth with both hands. I also shrugged my head and looked at the signs of the next room, but fortunately Suguha did not appeared. She does not get up till 30 minutes before doing the morning practice even if an earthquake and a typhoon come together.

Alice cleared her throat, and surely glared at me.

"Your strange reaction, we can get to the main subject when it passes"

"That ... ... That's rude ... Eh, oh, yeah, it's okay now."

She stood up with a light sigh and a faint motor sound, and Alice opened the mouth as she changed her expression.

"About five minutes ago .... The message of a strange content reached me via the network, not a remote telecommunication ... ...."

"Email? From whom?"

"There is no name of the sender, the content is better ...... It is better to look at the sentence as it is said in message."

Wiggle and move your eyes and stare at the printer installed on my desk.

Suddenly the printer began to rotate the exhaust fan, being warmed up. Definitely, Alice gave a printer an order by wireless connection. How long did you learn this kind of thing?

I was surprised with that.

But when I took the paper spit out by printer and put my eyes on the sentences instantly blew off surprise to the horizon.

Horizontal text, its contents —.

【Climb the white tower to reach that world.

The Cloudtop Garden. Large kitchen Armory. The Morning Star Lookout. Sacred Staircase Great Corridor of Spiritual Light】

I could not understand what I was seeing for more than five seconds.

As the head that was in a semi-awake state starts to work, I realize the word Alice's "unusual thing" word.

The contents of the first line was clear.

The problem is the second line. List of familiar names that are engraved black there.

The Cloudtop Garden...... The Morning Star Lookout... These are definitely the names from the Axiom Church Grand Cathedral which was standing in the center of the Underworld human world capital Centoria.

But then, who the sender of this mail is?

In the real world, there should be only two people who know the internal structure of Cathedral in detail. In other words, it is me and Alice.

Even though Kikuoka and Higa and RATH staff could monitor from the outside the governing body called the Axiom Church, the name of the floors could not have been studied very much. Also, many VRMMO players logged in Underworld as reinforcements like Asuna and Klein, but they appeared in the wilderness of the dark territory far from Centoria and logged out almost on the spot. They should have had no chance of seeing Cathedral with their own eyes.

Well.

I traced the text again in detail, I realized that I could hardly believe it.

The name "Sacred Staircase", visible in the second half of the second line. Even though I recognized the name of such a floor, I do not remember passing through. In other words, the sender of this mail is writing down content that I do not even know.

I turned my eyes to Alice of a tense expression and asked.

"... .... Alice. Is there a place called Sacred Staircase in Cathedral?"

"Yeah ... ... it definitely exists"

The knight nodded and gripped the white hands tightly and kept on.

"But ... ... it is kept secret ... Though Sacred Staircase is within the majestic hundred floor Cathedral, it is remnants of a small church when it had only three floors long ago! It is sealed down and can not be seen easily, there should be only three persons who know of its existence being the head elder, me, and ... ... the highest priest administrator ... "

"What ..."

I panted by a further surprise.

Alice took a step and tightened my right hand tightly. Due to the malfunction of the EAP cylinder, its fingertips are trembling finely.

"Kirito ...... No way ... ... No way ... I can’t think she is alive ......? That half-god man ...... Highest priest ... ....?"

A deep awe was gathered in the voice that was issued.

I gently hold down a delicate shoulder with my left hand.

"No, it is impossible ... The highest priest surely died, I and the former head elder Chyudelkin together with her, I saw them burning in the light, surely saw ... Now, look here."

Show to Alice a print on the right hand.

"On the first line, it says: ‘Climb the white tower and lead to that world.’ The white tower is Central Cathedral, and ‘that world’ means the Underworld. If I am an Administrator, I will never write like this, ‘my world’, I would write then. "

"Yeah ... it is, certainly, one can be confident."

Alice nods at such a distance that golden forelocks are likely to touch my skin.

"But ... ... Who is this document on ... ...."

"I do not understand, the material to guess is too short ... And even... ... If I know the sender, I still don’t understand the meaning of this sentence..."

"Meaning……?"

"Yeah, if you read well, there are many strange places"

I urged Alice to sit on the bed side by side, traced the print sentence with my fingertips.

"In the first row, it writes about climbing the tower, good so far...Then, line 2 is something wrong, is not it? The first "Cloudtop Garden", this is the floor you and I fought for the first time. However, next is "Large kitchen Armory". Although I do not know the big kitchen, it is supposed to be down there close to an armory I know, which on the third floor. "The Lookout of the Morning Star". This is the floor where we hardly managed to climb the outer wall and to go back inside of Cathedral, mostly the top of the tower. The order is too random."

"Yeah ... that was ... ... nostalgic .... When we were swinging on a sword stuck into the outer wall of the tower, you said to me those things"

"You do not have to remember that far"

Looking up at me shrinking my neck, Alice smiled faintly.

"But, in reality, I was a little happy, because it was the first time I spoke to someone from the bottom of my heart,"

In spite of myself, I openly smiled.

It is because of the sapphire lens's eyes looking as if it is slightly moist.

From the shining like that deep bottom, I gazed at all my mental power and moved my eyes away. Continue to explain with a slightly hoarse voice.

"... and the location of reading points is also weird... why there are ones around the ‘Large Kitchen Armory’ , and there is no point between the ‘Sacred Staircase’ and ‘The Great Corridor of the Spiritual Light’?"

Alice echoed low driving sound and gazed back to print.

"... ... ... forgetting to write ... is not it ...?"

Two people tilt their heads in the same direction, but no further ideas came out.

Inevitably I took out a small device from the wall rack in order to summon a helper who is good at deciphering such things.

The black hemisphere that can be placed on the palm is a high-performance network camera that is called "audiovisual bi-directional communication probe". Turn on the power, mounted on the right shoulder, and then checked with desktop PC to confirm that it has wirelessly connected.

"Yui, are you awake?"

Then, in about two seconds, the voice of what I had heard sounded from the probe's speaker.

"Fuai ...... Good morning, Daddy"

The camera rotates in the dome and also greets person sitting next to me.

"Good morning, Alice"

"Ah ... good morning, Yui"

This is the first time that Alice looks at the probe, but she had a conversation with Yui many times with Alvheim. Understanding that my right shoulder device is Yui's terminal in the real world, immediately returned a greeting with a smile.

Yui was still turning the camera around, but then after some silence she asked with s sort of raised voice.

"... .... Dad. What is the situation you have there?"

"No, no, nothing foolish, everything is normal."

"The time is three o'clock in the morning, and it is unlikely that you can judge the situation that Alice-san alone in the room of dad as ‘normal’"

"No, no, it is certain that it is irregular, but even though I was in a different situation ..."

On behalf of me trying desperate excuses, Alice explained the situation with a smiley look.

"Yui, it's not really anything, it’s just we received a strange email, I am consulting with Kirito."

"If Alice says so, I'll record it that way. But daddy, you can not keep secret from mom. "

"Of course, for sure."

On the right side of me quietly breathing in relief, Alice explains the contents while showing Yui a printout of the problem.

Looking at the scenes that these two people are talking about, I always enveloped in unexpected feelings.

Yui is a top-down type AI evolved to the limit whose program executed on the existing computer architecture.

And Alice is a down-top type AI with a totally new architecture imitating the human brain called the LightCube.

The scene where two artificial intelligences born from the opposite approaches meet and have natural and happy conversation seemed miraculous ... ....

I secretly caught a tear, while they exchanged opinions with each other, but eventually Yui noticed something.

"That ... .... If you look closely, the shapes of the points are different on the first line and the second line"

"Oh, really?"

I bring my face closer to Alice's printout and stare at the black spot of 1 mm or less.

_Certainly, Yui is right. The first line, between "climbing" and "that world" is the usual reading point._ (//katakana word separator, ‘•’, not in the original text though/)  
_However, what is struck three times in the second line seems to be a period_ (//he means ‘。’, Japanese full-stop sign/) _rather than a reading point. Or a dot?  
Dot……._

"Ah ... ... Ah!"

I shouted low and I sat down.

"Well, that's right, because cathedral has only one hundred stories ... so connect the two ... ... that is ..."

Grabbing the ball pen from the head board. Pull off the cap and ask Alice with a nervous voice.

"Alice. What floor was the Cloudtop Garden?"

"... ... Did you forget the place where Kirito first fought with me?"

"No, I have not forgotten, um ... ..."

"It's the 80th floor"

In the margin of the print I make a note of what is told to me with a slightly rebellious voice.

"It seemed to be so ... So what about the Kitchen?"

"It's the 10th floor"

I was writing the numbers told on paper one after another.

"The Lookout is ... .... ... Sacred Staircase is on the first floor ... ... Great corridor ... ...."

When I stopped, the white paper had four numbers separated by three dots lined up.

It’s visual appearance resembled something — very close. A kind of form that my race is familiar to on a daily basis.

The moment I saw it, Yui also shouted a little.

"Hey ... this is the IP address, Dad!"

"I think so"

As of 2006, almost for everything the IPv6 format is utilized, instead of the old generation IPv4 format. But it is not that v4 is unusable.

This mail points to a server that exists somewhere in the real world.

When I jumped out of bed, I sat on the mesh chair in front of the desk and grabbed the mouse. Launched a browser on a monitor broke from sleep mode, first attempt to connect to the problem server by HTTP, then FTP. But neither connection succeeded.

"RSTP ...... no, telnet? ...?" (//FYI: he means RTSP for sure (media streaming), but original says RSTP (low-level 802.1w network tree spanning)/)

While saying grumbling, I tried to launch a command prompt, when from my right shoulder—

Yui gave out a serious voice again.

"Dad! Once again, remember the text of the email! "

"Wha ...?"

From behind, Alice gives prints. Yui says while watching it with the camera.

"I think the ‘climb the white tower’ is pointing to the composition of address itself on the second line."

"Hmmm"

"And, as far as by ‘tower’ you get to ‘that world’, the server indicated by this address is ... ..."

"A ... ...! That was ... that was!"

While I felt my fingers cold and numb, I turned around.

"Alice. This is that world... that's where the Underworld runs!"

As soon as I let out that shout, Alice's eyes, standing behind me, opened wide.

"... .... to connect...... the way ... ... I can go, yes, I can go back to that world ... ... to my world ..."

To a whispered word, I nodded deeply with conviction.

The driving sound of the actuator sounded high, and the body that jumped straight in, I accepted with both hands.

It seems that perhaps it was an illusion caused by the feeling of the natural female cry close, but it seemed like the droplets touched my ear.

Because it should not have such a function in a machine body made of metal and silicon.

I did not have enough patience to wait until commonsense time, neither had Alice.

Therefore, I strongly feeling sorry that it was early in the morning after midnight, still mercilessly called Rinko's mobile terminal.

Fortunately, she seems to have stayed at the Roppongi branch. At first it seemed not to understand what it is, but as soon as my explanation came to the point, the voice of mixed screaming returned, "Is that so !?"

"Really, tracing of the originator of the message is impossible first, but it can be thought of as real based on the content."

『That ... ... That's right. Then, I have to make preparations now ... 』

That's right, to the doctor who tossed out, I flew back.

"That role ... ... Please let me do it together with Alice."

『Eh……』

Next breathing I heard will be half astonished half sighing surprises.

『Kirigaya-kun ... your..., I have met such eyes ...』

"If you are a person who is discouraged by that, you are not doing a byte in the first place from the beginning!"

Again, long breath.

『... That's right, right. It is because this is so a special case, This time you can do it. But please ... let's get permission from the parents properly next time.』

"Of course, please leave it to me .... I want you to check with you something... .... When Alice connects to Ocean Turtle from there, will she use STL?』

『No, it's not necessary. Alice's LightCube Package works exactly the same as your combined living brain and STL. All I need is a cable.』

"Well, if it is, if ... ... Uh, please wait a moment."

I looked at the face of Alice clenching both hands next to me.

"Alice ... That's bad, but maybe she can take me with you ... and Asuna too"

One eyebrow moves, above one's eyes.

Light motor sound, instead of sighing.

"... Well, let's do it, if it comes to an unexpected situation, a fighting power is never enough."

"Well, I will take it, .... Uh, that's why, doctor ...."

After a short dialogue, I switched off the call, ringed up Asuna and told the situation.

She seemed to realize the future development just by saying that a connection path to the Underworld was found.

Finish the call in just one or two minutes, finally remove the right shoulder probe and look into the lens.

"... I'm sorry, Yui, I have not found a way to take you to the Underworld ..."

Apologizing, hoping the girl will understand... ... but she answered it a bit lonely.

"Yes, I know, Dad. Please be careful and go. "

"Someday I will take Yui with me."

Promised and put the probe on the desk.

Next to that, reference books and texts etc. which were supposed to be able to proceed from today are accumulated tightly. Those unwillingly will come in a while ahead.

Pull out a piece of blank paper from the built-in tray of the printer and quickly run the ballpoint pen. Together with Alice, who had collected uniform from Suguha’s room, changed our clothes standing backs to each other and leaving the room slinking.

Get off the stairs and put handwritten note on the living room table.

Carefully opening old sliding doors, I and Alice stepped outside into the atmosphere of early morning which made me feel a little cool.

Push the 125cc bike far enough away from home and then straddle the seat. Alice wears helmet that Suguha uses, and when she is also ready, turn the ignition.

Despite leaving it for almost three months, Tandem started up the engine at a moderate pace.

"Do not be afraid! It’s same like riding a dragon!"

Alice responds while turning his hand to my belly.

"Who do you think I am!"

"Haha, that's it, you are an integrity knight ... Well, let's go!"

The sentence left in the living room at home is as follows.

【Father, Mother, Suguha. I have an adventure outside in Chiyoda. I will leave soon so do not worry】

Running through the early morning empty Kawagoe Highway, 7th Ring way, then 246th road, arrived to RATH Roppongi branch. In front of it has appeared Asuna who had already arrived by taxi.

She tried to shake hands with a smile, and notices Alice riding behind me and changes the expression a lot.

"... ... Kirito-kun, what does this all mean?"

"Well ... ... Uh, that briefly, it was various, but nothing ...... ..."

"Details about the contents of ‘nothing’, ‘various’, please?”

It was understood that this would happen. While understanding, I dare to come here without any problem. Because there is no reason to be able to explain moderately.

"I will make a detailed story soon, I will absolutely! .... Old tea ceremony etc. ..."

Add an ending tail and stop the motorcycle in the staff parking lot.

In the eye I looked back, the fearful scene came into my eyes.

Asuna standing with both hands against her waist. Alice stands with arms on her chest. You can see the electric light burning the air tightly in between the confronting sides.

I was afraid to speak to them.

"...... Hey, you guys, I thought it was already over ...... Back then, in the camp of the Human world defense army ... ...."

"That was a ceasefire negotiation not the end!"

"Ceasefire is what is done on the premise of resuming war!"

At the same time, I moved my sight between two.

Stared at the appearance of the two swordswomen for a while — ready to fight the full battle.

I did the only thing I could do on this occasion.

In other words, it disappeared as much as possible, and gradually retreated while trying to escape to the inside of the entrance.

However, as soon as I finished authenticating the ID card, fingerprints and retina in a strict security system, a shrill sound was heard, and the two turned quickly at this point.

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0390.jpg)

『Ah, hey, Kirito-kun!』

"We came as fast as we could !!"

When I heard her voice, I'm already jumping into the building.

I breathlessly arrived at the STL room, together with Asuna and Alice who did not exchange a word but the temperature between them was rising, Dr. Koujiro welcomed me with round eyes.

"... ... I understand you are impatient, but if you do not run so much, STL and the underworld will not run away, right?"

Answered to a doctor who gives a shaky voice with a smile.

"Well, I'd like to connect as soon as possible! Whatever the reason, if this dive succeeds, it also greatly affects the security and the future underworld!"

The bizarre voice of Asuna was the result of pinching the right flank.

Before being pursued by Alice, she retreats to the adjoining changing room to change into the sterile garment for the STL dive.

As a matter of fact, the words she told doctor is also the truth without exaggeration.

Ocean Turtle berthing off the Izu Islands is currently in a very subtle situation. There is only one way to maintain its operation and independence at the moment.

Human fluctlight — that is to promote the exchange of underworld people and people of the real world, and to develop a friendly relationship. If the majority of real-world people admit that underworld people are also human beings, countries and companies can not be brute force either.

Impossible ——.

Specifically, there are other abusive subjects to be aware of.

Acquisition of practical defense capability. It is "light cube mounted type unmanned fighter" which should already be under development, independent of country.

Nonetheless, it is still a delusion. How long will it take for underworld people who know only dragons to be able to control supersonic fighters to get UAV, ... ... or how to put up maintenance costs, how many months? There are too many hurdles to clear.

Either way, absolutely necessary is a large capacity circuit other than the communication satellite under government control. In order for the underworld people to connect to The Seed Nexus for them and to inform the real world people of their existence.

Whether it will be possible or not depends on one IP address that is written in the note I put in my chest pocket.

After finishing changing clothes, I left the changing room and offered a note to Dr. Rinko.

Doctor was a little hesitant to receive. But immediately pick up the right hand and took the piece of paper.

"... ... could it be that person is involved, is not it?"

I quietly nodded in a word that was silently emitted.

_I do not know who would knew the unique name of each layer of Cathedral. But that is only possible for that man, things such as establishing a secret line that connects Ocean Turtle and the Internet.  
Kayaba Akihiko ... or Heathcliff.  
Think about it.  
My battle can not be over without direct confrontation with that man. This time, Heathcliff passed past me sleeping in the STL, and he went out again to the darkness of the network work again. But someday it will show up again. In order to collect a large number of fragments born from steel floating castle and to settle everything._

I turned away from Dr. Koujiro who began preparing dives and I started my mobile device.

"Yui. Did you know something about the address in the message?"

Yui reflected on the screen shook her pretty face sideways.

『The location of the server is Iceland, but it seems to be a simple relay point. The barrier is tougher and we can not explore further.』

"Okay ... thanks ... Did you track the sender of the message that arrived at Alice?"

『That is ... ... I found a trace of it at The Seed Nexus node 304, but then I also lost it ... 』

Shay the head of Yui, who drops her shoulders, with my fingertips through the touch panel.

"No, it's enough ... Three hundreds are in the US, you do not have to chase any more ... Direct contact, even for Yui, is dangerous, because it should be almost same as Yui. "

"My side is better!"

Showed puffed cheeks with a bitter smile.

"Well, I will go there for the time being, next time I think there is no more danger of this or that ..."

"If something happens, I will go to help immediately! "

"I'm counting on you, huh, well, again."

Touched the extended little hand with my finger across the screen, I turned off the terminal. At that time, Alice and Asuna who changed clothes came out of the women's changing room.

Fortunately, it seems that he signed a second armistice agreement, and both faces are shining with expectations.

I looked at two people in turn, and said.

"... .... After two hundred years, I have no idea what the human world and the dark world are like. Well, it is shorter than the 300 years that the administrator dominated the human world, so I do not think there is such a drastic change... "

Alice nods deeply and answers.

"At least it seems certain that Central Cathedral exists, so let's think that the human world also is."

Asuna smiled while touching Alice's arms.

"The first thing I should do is let Selka awake"

"Yeah!"

Once again, nodding deeply.

We got to the two STLs and one legged reclining seat respectively.

I put my body in a cool cold jelly bed. By the operation of Dr. Rinko, a huge head block gets down and falls and covers over the forehead.

"Well then ... let’s go"

Responds came to the doctor's words in different voices.

"Yes!"

A huge machine raises a low roar.

A photon network that constitutes my consciousness — the Fluctlight — is separated from the body, and the five senses and gravity are lost.

Consciousness is translated into electrical signal and jumps out to a vast external network.

It rushes a large capacity optical line at ultra high speed and flies to a nostalgic world.

To a new adventure.

Into the next story.

***

First we saw the light.

Extremely small white sparkle, becoming a rainbow-colored synchrotron radiation, — further spreading, covering the sight.

In the end, pure black appeared.

I dived straight to the darkness ahead of the tunnel of light.

No, it is not perfect darkness.

With a black backdrop, a dreadful number of colorful light spots are quietly blinking.

It is stars. Night sky……

Both are wrong.

Because.

"... .... um, wow ah !?"

I screamed at the moment when I looked down on the feet.

Because the ground does not exist.

In a panic, I let both legs flutter, but the bottom of the boots does not touch anything. Infinite starry sky will only last around. Even if you look sideways, look up, stars and stars.

"Kyaaaaa!?"

"Th — This is……!?"

I heard such voices on the right and left.

My hands spread all the way up at the same time.

Looking to the right, the pearl half-armor and the same color skirt, Asuna who was dressed in Stacia’s garb with the brilliant rapier, floating.

On the left, Alice equipped with a golden breastplate and white long skirt, white silk whip and waist braid and long sword on the waist.

Both of us looked at the endless starry sky spreading in front of our eyes.

Impossible.

This is not just a starry sky.

"……space……?"

I was dreadfully scared.

As soon as this, I felt the ferocious cold. Alice and Asuna also, started sneezing and coughing. It is a furious low temperature environment where you can feel that the Life is suddenly decreasing.

No, it is not real space, I couldn’t hear the voice of two people if it is, but it is nearly unlimited.

We are living there and floating.

I concentrated my consciousness and develop defensive walls of light attribute in a spherical shape, enclosing everyone.

As soon as we were wrapped in a thin sparkle, the cold that pierces me went away.

Finally relaxed, I looked around the spectacular sight before my eyes again.

From the upper right to the lower left of the field of view, a dense group of close stars continues in bands. No matter how hard you connect the bright stars, you can not find any constellations familiar in the real world, so it is safe to say that it’s not Milky Way.

Again, this is an Underworld.

_But then, the earth ... and where did the sky go?_

Suddenly it was attacked by intense chill, and I frown.

_No way.  
I wonder if it disappeared ......  
At the end of two hundred years time, the Life of the earth itself, which constitutes the human world and the dark world, is exhausted.  
Whether everything has returned to Nothingness with the tens of thousands of people who lived there ... ...._

"It's a lie ... ... Such a thing ..."

With trembling voice, mumbled voice on the left side.

Suddenly, Alice grasped my hand so strongly as she can.

"Kirito ... ... over there"

The golden knight had turned her body to where she turned her face to the left before, and was staring right behind. The stretched hand pointing straight to a point.

I also slowly turned around slowly while holding my breath.

I saw a star.

It was not a small twinkling star in the far side — a huge planet that covered some of the sight was there.

The upper half of the sphere is sinking in dense darkness.

However, from the middle, black slowly changes to indigo, to ultramarine blue, and further to azure.

And the semicircular arc that borders the lower side is dazzlingly light blue.

Light blue color gradually increases the brightness gradually. White light was raised in the center part of the arc, and the light beam of the horizontal straight line quickly expanded.

It was a dawn.

The sun — Solus, hidden behind the planet, — is about to reveal its appearance.

We turn our eyes away from dazzling white light and look at the surface of the planet again.

The surface which had been sunk in the deep indigo until recently gradually stains into a bright blue.

Beyond the white clouds clunky, there was a continental contour line.

A slightly rounded upside-down triangle.

There is one set of white light near the upper right corner of the continent. On the upper left, we saw a larger group of lights. Clearly the light of civilization. If you look carefully, a line of light lines running in two rows, extending further downwards, runs like a mesh.

I instantly realized what I was seeing from the shape of the continent and the position of the two big cities.

The city in the upper right is Obsidia, the capital of the Dark territory.

And the upper left is Centoria, center of the human world.

That continent, lit by that star is the Underworld that I used to live, fight, rush through.

I moved the line of sight, I saw the Alice nearby.

Even on that white face, only a deep surprise and awe are emerging.

Alice unexpectedly opened her eyes wide and with her hand searched for a small pouch equipped with a sword belt.

What was taken out was two small eggs that could fit in the palm.

One is shining green and the other is blue. Light inside repeatedly becomes strong and weak at almost two second interval. Just like breathing. Like a heartbeat.

Alice hugged two eggs in her chest and closed the eyelids. Then, tears flowed without sound, soared, dripping and dripping with water droplets.

I felt tears spreading in my own eyes. Looking at the other side, the eyes of Asuna who still held my hand were wet as well.

While we were watching, Alice stepped on the stars seas and went out step-by-step. Holding two eggs with her left hand and extend her right hand straight towards a huge planet.

In the eyes of the same color as the stars of the dawn, with the infinite radiance, the golden integrity knight exclaimed in a high loud voice.

"This is the world !! The Underworld I was born in and I loved! Hear me!"

The stars in the whole universe trembled and the blue planet bolstered its light for a moment as if being alive.

I closed my eyelids and made my ears open.

In order to forever engrave in my memory the words that tell us about a new era will.

"I have returned home now! ... ...I am here !!"
