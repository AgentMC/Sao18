## Часть 4

"Фуа", — зевнул я и проснулся.

Мозг наполнило ставшее уже привычным замешательство. Где это я сейчас, и "сейчас" — это когда?

Однако, это чувство непривычности выветривалось с каждым днём. Прошлое отступало, так сказать, как утекающая вдаль вода. Это было радостно и грустно одновременно.

Лёжа в постели, я посмотрел вверх на часы на стене.

4 часа дня. Похоже, я проспал около полутора часов после того как принял душ, справившись с больничным обедом.

Белый свет и тёмные тени, отбрасываемые жалюзи, разукрашивали палату контрастным узором. Если прислушаться, то ушей достигнет слабый крик ребёнка. А ещё городские шум и суета, создаваемые множеством машин и бессчётными людьми.

Я глубоко вдохнул воздух, пахнущий солнцем и антисептиком, медленно выдохнул и встал из кровати.

Я пересёк небольшую частную палату и подошёл к окну, выходящему на юг. Раздвинул шторы обеими руками.

Сузив от яркого света глаза, я смотрел на раскинувшийся передо мной огромный город. Реальный Мир, поглощающий громадные ресурсы, продолжавший уверенно и интенсивно работать. Мир, в котором я был рождён.

И хотя меня переполняла радость от возвращения, я всё же чувствовал желание вернуться в тот мир. Однажды, когда придёт время, я снова покину этот город.

Мои уши услышали слабый стук. Я развернулся и сказал "Войдите", и дверь отъехала, явив мне фигуру посетителя.

Длинные каштановые волосы собраны в две косы. Летняя юбка-клёш цвета голубого льда в белую полоску. Босоножки тоже белые.

Сразу заморгала обоими глазами из-за лучей света, падавших прямо на неё.

Асуна, которую выпустили из больницы три дня назад, немного раньше, чем меня, улыбнувшись, помахала букетиком в правой руке.

"Прости, я опоздала немного."

"Нет, всё в порядке, я только что встал."

Я вернул улыбку и легко обнял Асуну, когда она вошла в комнату.

Левая рука Асуны пробежалась по моей руке и спине.

"Ну — это уже около 90% стандартного Кирито. Ты хорошо ешь?"

"Ем я, нормально ем. Ничего не поделать, я всё же два месяца проспал."

С горькой улыбкой я поднял обе руки и пожал плечами.

"И вообще, они уже решили отпустить меня, дата — послезавтра."

"Правда!?"

С просиявшим лицом Асуна подошла к вазе, стоящей на тумбочке.

"Класс, отпразднуем с тобой это событие, сначала в ALO, потом в реальности."

Быстро сменив воду в вазе, она убрала завявшие цветы, вставила вместо них две ярко-пурпурные розы и возвратила вазу на место.

Понаблюдав какое-то время за розами, пока они не стали чисто синими<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, я вернулся к прежнему положению.

Я сел на кровать, Асуна подошла и села ко мне на колени.

Навевает воспоминания. Но по сравнению с прошлым разом, я не чувствовал разрывающей душу боли.

Я обнял плечи Асуны, откинувшейся назад, и обратил своё сознание в память.

В тот день.

Мы с Асуной, оставшиеся в Подмирье, вошедшем в фазу критического ускорения, полетели прочь от цветущего "Алтаря Завершения", сквозь угольно-чёрную пустыню, мимо формаций красных скал, и прежде всего объединились с Армией защиты Мира людей, всё ещё остававшейся на поле боя в древних руинах.

Кляйн, Эгиль, Лизбет и прочие. Вокруг не осталось и следа от подкреплений из Реального Мира. Их автоматически разлогинило одновременно с началом ускорения.

Успокоив плачущих Тейзу и Ронье, я предстал перед юным рыцарем целостности Ренри и Сортелиной-семпай. Мы перегруппировали наши отряды и двинулись на север.

Я вернулся к "Великим Восточным Вратам".

Там я нашёл заместителя главы рыцарей целостности Фанатио, рыцаря Дюсольберта и учениц рыцарей Физель и Линель, остававшихся в этом месте, уже разделившие радость воссоединения с рыцарем целостности Шейтой, которая передала мне сообщение от лидера клана кулачных бойцов, ставшего временным командующем Тёмной Армией.

Он желал, через месяц после возвращения армии Тёмной Территории в свою столицу далеко на востоке, когда выжившие генералы закончат разбираться с последствиями войны, провести переговоры с армией Мира Людей. Проводив Шейту, добровольно вызвавшуюся на роль посла и улетевшую на восток на своём сером драконе, все воины Армии защиты Мира Людей вернулись домой в столицу Центорию.

Жители городов и деревень вдоль нашего пути уже каким-то образом узнали, что война окончилась и настал мир, и встречали Армию защиты с ужасным воодушевлением.

После возвращения в Центорию, дни понеслись один за другим.

## Продолжение завтра

We were busy by helping Fanatio who is the highest rank knight after the death of Bercouli with the rebuilding of the postwar, compensation to the family of the warriors who was sacrificed in the war and the axioms church, the holdback of Four Emperors and the Great aristocrats who tried to expand authority, and soon one month passed.

Again encountered the chairman Isukan which formally became the commander officer of the dark world army at the place of the farewell negotiations which was held again in the site of the the Great Eastern Gate.

A burning red warrior, a little younger than me, told me on the spot.

_— You’re older brother of "Green swordsman Leafa". They say you slayed Emperor Vector.  
— I do not doubt, let me try once._

And I and Isukan cried out each other without fight at the conference room and after that he nods as if he was convinced of something.

_— Certainly you are better than the emperor, and stronger than me. So, I will appreciate it ... .... If the praise is the first ... ...._

At that point, my memory is interrupted dully.

In the next scene, Higa Takeru-san of RATH is saying "I erased the memory, it was completed successfully" to me who woke up at the STL's gel bed.

According to Dr. Rinko Koujiro, me and Asuna said they have continued Underworld simulation for more than 200 years, far beyond the capacity limit of fluctlight. But I can not remember what I was doing for such a long time and how I avoided the collapse of fluctlight. The terrible thing is that after the awakening at the RATH Roppongi branch, I have completely forgotten the conversation that I exchanged with both Higa and Kikuoka.

It seems that Asuna is similar.

But she said with a usual honed smile.

_— Because it is about Kirito, it is definitely that he was going to run into various kinds of disputes and I had to rush away girls here and there._

I do not feel like forcibly remembering when I say so, but I can not erase just the painful feeling of loneliness.

Because it is probably already at this moment also in the underworld which should continue to operate at the same magnification time, Fanatio and Renri integrity knights, Isukan leading dark world men, Ronier, Tiese, Sortilina-sempai and Azurika-sensei are not alive ... ....

Asuna whispered suddenly as if I read my mind.

"Even if memory disappears, recollection remains"

_— That's it, Kirito. Do not cry ... Stay cool._

A nostalgic voice echoes gently in the back of the ear.

That's it. Recollections are not saved only in the memory field of the brain. It is engraved firmly in the fluctlight network that spreads throughout the whole body of cells.

I shaken off the tears that blew me off with blinks and stroked Asuna's hair while responding.

"Oh, someday... .... you can meet again."

A gentle tranquil time lasted for several minutes.

The western sun which falls on a white wall gradually makes its color shade darker. Occasionally the shadows of the birds returning to the roost cross the wall.

It was knocking again that broke the silence.

I grazed my head lightly. Although I should not have scheduled meetings at this time, I will be forced to take your hand off the Asuna's shoulder and answer.

"Please come in"

As soon as the doors slid, that nostalgic sound harshly felt.

"Hey, you finally leave the hospital, Kirito-kun! This means I don’t have much time. ... .... Well, oh, I guess you packing things already?"

I returned the words with the sigh.

"...... Do you know the entire schedule of discharge or is that you just asked Aki-san? I am not in hurry, Kikuoka-san"

Former second-ranking officer of the Virtual department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Seichiro Kikuoka, the former commander of the disguised corporate RATH, came in the hospital room with a strange appearance that was beating with a bad tasteful shirt form the other day.

Although it is midsummer, he wears a suit that seems to be high-class, he is tightening up a necktie. It gently strokes short hair and does not float one sweat on face with thin frameless glasses.

Even when viewed from any direction, it is ruining the appearance made by a foreign-owned company's elite businessman as usual grin laughter and smelly paper bags lowered on the right hand.

Kikuoka said lifting the bag with grace.

"This is a present, because Kirito is to have physical fitness, it is quite hard to make it here, because Dr. Rinko absolutely says with a scary face against any common food. But, for fermented foods to recover, I can not yield this much, so I made a lot of assortments. First of all, I bought fresh Nigorobuna from Lake Biwa. And it is Okinawa's Tofuyo, it is awesome to do Awamori with this. And even if it is said that this cheese, it is not just cheese, the bright gem of the direct import of France, Époisses! While every day while aging for a long time, a nice microorganism on the surface propagates breeding fortune, a little smell like Tamaran ...... "

"Refrigerator, there it is"

I cut off the long and wide tongue that Kikuoka is stabbing with a fascinated face and pointed at the corner of the hospital room.

"What is it?"

"Thank you for putting in, thank you and refrigerator, there"

"Well, let's open it"

"The window of this room, it is a locked dead! What do you think will happen if you open such a thing?"

A fragrant scarcely drifts from the paper bag already, Asuna retreats with delicate expression.

"I think that it is a good smell ... —— I always say it, honestly think it’s OK. Kirito-kun is strangely calm today."

Kikuoka sat down in the chair for the visitor when putting the insertion in the refrigerator while saying sweet things.

Quickly get back to the usual smile, and align the fingertips of both hands on the knee you braided.

"Anyways, it was really good, thoughtfully, Kirito had been in a coma all the while since physically injured by an accomplice of the "Death Gun case" at the end of June. It is truly young to be reassured by weekly rehabilitation. "

"Ah ... ... well ... ... I am indebted to you, I guess it should be said that ... ...."

I groaned, closing face with hands.

I've recovered to this point as a result of a stroke in cardiopulmonary arrest, thanks to STL's activation of fractal stimulation. But for this reason this guy carried me from a hospital in the hospital with a camouflaged ambulance and airlifted all the way to Ocean Turtle off the Izu Island all the way by helicopter.

I understand the circumstances that I could not get the formal procedures. My STL treatment would have contended for a moment and RATH is a secret organization that can not reveal its existence. Rather, thanks in all to Kikuoka who crossed the dangerous bridge so far to help me.

— Although there is something.

"......Kikuoka-san. When I dived to the underworld for the second time, was it a really unexpected accident that the memory block did not work and I woke up in the northern border of the human world as it was? "

"Of course"

Kikuoka diluted his smile and nodded.

"At that point, there was no meaning to drop you in the underworld as it is to the real world, as simulation was contaminated. Well actually, you corrected the trajectory of the world that had already been contaminated by Yanai... .... " (//WAT!? I thought they did it on purpose to restore Kirito’s brain activity by direct writing there, hence no memory block and other blocks which actually caused Kirito’s fluctlight to be damaged later, no?/)

"Astonishing, I wonder how did you allow the subordinate of that Sugo to RATH......"

A glimpse of the Asuna standing next to him.

Asuna blew away a different kind of hatred and rubbed her shoulder lightly with his palm.

"I think it's horrifying to think that I was being for hours in the room next to one with this slug, who shoot Higa ... ... I really wanted him to be caught properly and be judged on all confessions but……"

"But, that way of dying may have been rather lucky."

Kikuoka quietly answers.

"If Yanai joined the assailants as scheduled and could escape to the United States as planned, it would not seem that NSA and Glowgen Defense Systems, which were clients, allowed him to keep his mouth shut, regarding STL and human fluctlight. After having discharged the knowledge by any means, he would have been sorted out, the dark side of an American military company is not a person to which one person can crossover."

"Is it reason why Kikuoka-san is supposed to die?"

"Oh, come on now."

In contrast to his own words, a man who continues to challenge a single enormous enemy, laughed a smile and spread his hands.

Asuna said on a face that seemed to be bothering, looking at its grueling gestures.

"... What are you going to do now? The official responsible for Lars has been delegated to Dr. Rinko and can not you face too much at the Roppongi branch?"

"Worry not, I have something to do but for now we must do our utmost to preserve the Ocean Turtle and the Underworld"

The story that I wanted to know the most was suddenly coming out, I instinctively started.

"So, what happens to the Underworld in the future ...?"

"... ... the situation is not quite optimistic"

Kikuoka looked outside the window while getting up.

"Ocean Turtle is currently anchored and blocked off the coast of the Izu Island, there are only a few staff members for reactor maintenance and security inside the ship, the escort ship strictly monitors the surrounding waters. Speaking of ...... I can hear it, but the point is on hold. The country can not make a decision. "

"On hold……?"

"To tell the truth, the government will immediately dismantle RATH, or the Marine Resources Exploration Research Organization, and would like to put human fluctlight related technology under control. When mass production, ultra low cost labor is. All we can produce still can not compete with Asia's large-scale factory, but it will make it clear that that raids and occupying case is the truth. The master of the case is American NSA and military enterprise, that got the backing money and made the escort ship wait for 24 hours was the biggest scandal of being the active defense secretary general. It was also flowing to some ruling party agents, It is coalesced with major weapons makers of Japan. When these are completely exposed, the regime's backbone will shake "

The expressions of Kikuoka are alarmed by the stout words.

"Shaking ... Is it only?"

"Yes, there it is, but it will not go until we resume ... ... The ruling party should make a decision to truncate a few vice-ministers and parliamentarians, at the same time RATH was dismantled and all related technologies Alice brings it to the big company of the conglomerate system, Alice gets handed over, the destiny of Ocean Turtle and LightCube Cluster is inevitable ... "

"That ... ... That can’t be!"

Asuna cried out sharply. In the eyes of Hazel, a spark of anger glows a little.

I urged Kikuoka to keep going ahead while letting her arms touch his fingertips.

"Is there a way to avoid that situation already in your mind?"

"Hope, I wonder rather than measures ......"

An unusual honest smile spread to Kikuoka's mouth.

"The hope is that there is a favorable public opinion formed in us ... while the bargaining is continuing within the government ... That is to approve human rights to the human fluctlight, We must have people in the world to interact a lot more and for a long time with human fluctlight. The significance of existence of The Seed consolidation was exactly there.

"... ... That's right ..."

"But for that, the existence of a large capacity line for underworld people to connect to the seed consolidation is a prerequisite. The satellite line used by Ocean Turtle has been disconnected by the government. From now on I will aim for the restoration of the line because I made the first step at a news conference the other day, there should be a temporary grace for a while now. "

"Line ......"

I also looked up at the orange sky spreading out of the window.

Beyond that sunset, countless communication satellites are flying in their orbit. However, if the throughput is such that it can communicate with the underworld, the number should be considerably limited. I understand that Kikuoka's plan is rugged and difficult.

However, once you reach this point, there is nothing I can do for just being a high school student. Believe it, only trust it.

When I gazed back, I advanced one step and lowered my head.

"Kikuoka-san ...... I beg you, please protect the Underworld"

"There is no need to say"

Kikuoka also got up and smiled barely.

"For me too, underworld is now a dream that made a bet on life."

Seichiro Kikuoka-san leaves only a smelling gift paper bag, the one that came when him, and went out like a wind.

Asuna breathed a light breath, saying.

"Words and attitudes are also worthy and dependable ... but this time I feel like there seems to be a back side in Kikuoka's words...."

![Image](/Translate/Img/018_0319.jpg)

"Obviously, how many times we can be fooled"

I laughed briefly and sat down on the bed.

"True, but I do not think that Mr. Kikuoka has given up yet. Deploying a domestic fighter equipped with human fluctlight to the SDF."

"Oh ... .... Yeah!"

"Of course, I would not forcibly incorporate it as an AI without free will, but how about if you let an Underworlder find employment voluntarily? Integrity knights and dark knights are originally born as warrior and that’s it. "

"Ah ... ... well ... ... hmmm"

At the same time with Asuna to think about, I also make vague thinking.

The true purpose of Seichiro Kikuoka. That would be something that I can not even imagine at the moment. Something that is not far beyond politics and defense, perhaps as far as Kayaba Akihiko ... .... 

"Oh, I must leave! It is such time already!"

"Oh, the meeting time is still ... ...."

"Not so, today it is, ALO, Nine Race Joint meeting!"

"Ah ... so run."

I also meet both hands with a flap.

Last month's Ocean • Turtle raid incident.

Approximately 2 thousand VRMMO players in Japan made death-bailed relief by character conversion to counter the measures of massive launch of VRMMO enemy players from abroad that PoH commanded. Results: they have almost completely wiped out with only a few hundred people left.

Today it is supposed to hold a large-scale conference to report facts to the players who participated in that so-called "volunteer". Me and Asuna must participate naturally as special guests.

"Well, I guess there is no time to go home."

A little dazzlingly, Asuna took out the AmuSphere from the tote bag she brought.

"Can’t help, I also dive here."

"... ...."

I blink twice, I instinctively snag.

"...... Um, Asuna, whatever you aim at, I will do it for the first time..."

"Come on, it's different, just do not care about small details!"

For a moment I made my lips sharp, I smiled and suddenly collapsed on the bed to cover me. While thinking that Aki-san would come to the temperature warmer, I also turned his arm around a thin waist and bowed slowly.

In silence, only each other's breathing echoes.

_There is no way to know what kind of means overcomes the time of two hundred years that me and Asuna left behind in the underworld far exceed the limit of fluctlight.  
Perhaps we spent a long time sleeping like the highest priest administrator and may have continued to organize our memory by STL operation from inside. However, we can only affirm this. Because Asuna was by my side, I could come back to this world as I am. Through touching skin I felt like hearing the voice of Asuna._

_— Whatever world you go to. No matter how long it will pass.  
— Anytime, it's the same ... ...._

"... ... Oh, that's right."

I murmured by the real voice. Stroking the hair of the smiling Asuna, I gently put the Amusphere on her small head.

Locked the straps and powered it on, and I also wear it the same way.

Our eyes met, we nodded a little and we chanted the command at the same time.

"Link start".
